  Check out this custom quadrocopter, taken from concept to flight
  in just 2 weeks built using a RepRap 3D printer and an mbed for
  the electronics and control!

  Here is a video showing it in action:

  The mbed provides the 3 PID controllers needed for pitch, yaw and
  roll, and the gyros are taken from a Wii-motion plus. Great how
  to see the use of different rapid prototyping tools can pull
  something like this together in such a short amount of time!

  It was designed by a member of the Imperial College Robotics
  Society. You can see more details at:
