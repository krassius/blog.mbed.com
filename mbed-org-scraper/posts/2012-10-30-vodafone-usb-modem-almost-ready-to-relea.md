<p>
  Since the public beta trial was announced back in May, we've been
  collaborating with the guys at Vodafone and a small group of mbed
  developers who were keen to experiment with this technology.
  After a busy time developing, testing and debugging the USB modem
  driver, we're almost ready to publish it.
</p>
<p>
  The release is expected to happen at the end of October, and so
  now seems like a good time to start showing some of the things
  that have been happening, and the projects that have been built
  around the modem.

  First up is a project from <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/users/ashleymills">Dr Ashley Mills</a>, one of
  the Vodafone research guys we've been working closely with.
</p>
<p>
  Ashley put together this SMS feedback machine when we attended
  <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/Over-the-Air-2012/">Over The
  Air 2012</a> back in June. The idea is simple. It is a Vodafone
  USB Modem that can receive text messages, and a thermal printer
  that can print them out. Publicising the number at the beginning
  of a presentation enables people to text questions during the
  presentation. This might be useful to avoid forgetting the
  question before the end, or to avoid having to ask a question in
  front of a big audience.
</p>
<p>
  It worked really well, and Ashley has been using it ever since.
  It is a good example of the SMS receive functionality that the
  Vodafone USB Modem library provides being used for an application
  that didn't exist before.
