  Last week we got the chance to speak with <a href=
  "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robotiky/robotiky-make-coding-into-childs-play"
  rel="nofollow">Robotiky</a> about their Kickstarter project.
  Robotiky is a small programmable toy robot that makes learning
  how to code simple, digestible and best of all fun! The team
  prototyped the idea using an mbed-enabled <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/">NXP LPC1768</a>
  prototyping board, and then transitioned to a full custom design
  using the mbed HDK for <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC11U24/">NXP LPC11U24</a> board
  based on an ARM Cortex-M0+. The hardware features a voltage
  convertor, extension port and sensors for speed bumps, light and
  line following.

  One of the unique features of this special toy is the online
  tutorials that utilize drag and drop exercises to teach the
  basics of coding, from simple blocks to full code. In the
  tutorials after each level is completed you can download and run
  your program on the robot for immediate gratification and
  realization of what programming can actually create. This toy is
  aimed at elementary and primary school ages, but as an adult
  myself, I have to say I could not stop testing out all of the
  <a href="http://www.robotiky.com/demo/" rel="nofollow">demo</a>
  coding challenges until I completed each level!

  This robot and online programing tutorial is the brainchild of
  John Ginger and Matt Screeton, alumni’s of Cambridge University.
  They currently have eight days left on their <a href=
  "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robotiky/robotiky-make-coding-into-childs-play"
  rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> funding where you can get your own
  Robotiky for £99 and help them reach their goal. However there
  are limited spots at this funding level, so sign up for your
  Robot before the deal is up.
