  The mbed project has reached the 2.0 milestone!
</p>
<p>
  The key components are a new version of the SDK, released under a
  permissive open source license, and a new HDK for creating
  mbed-enabled low-cost development boards. But this really marks
  the culmination of a great year and lot of effort bringing new
  technology to the mbed platform, like the fully integrated online
  collaboration, question and answers area, full rtos and
  networking stacks, 3G connectivity, CMSIS-DAP and even tablet
  support within the online compiler!
</p>
<p>
  And the community has been hard at work too; the project now has
  hundreds of cookbook entries for module and component drivers and
  thousands of shared open source repositories. Great work
  everyone!
</p>
<p>
  Here is a little summary video that highlights what basing your
  projects on the mbed platform now gives you:

<h2>
  mbed 2.0 Roundup
</h2>
<p>
  The mbed platform is being developed by ARM, its Partners and a
  the global mbed developer community to deliver free tools and
  software for rapid prototyping with ARM microcontrollers.
</p>
<h2>
  Open Source SDK
</h2>

  </p>
</div>
<p>
  The mbed Software Development Kit (SDK), already relied upon by
  tens of thousands of developers, has been extended and released
  free under a permissive open source license. It has been
  carefully designed to provide a C/C++ platform with enough
  hardware abstraction to be intuitive and concise yet powerful
  enough to build complex projects fast, and is built on the ARM
  CMSIS low-level APIs to allow developers to go right down to the
  hardware when needed. It is portable across multiple popular
  toolchains and in addition to free open source middleware such as
  RTOS, USB and Networking libraries, the SDK has been built upon
  by the mbed developer community to create a cookbook of hundreds
  of reusable driver libraries for connecting to peripherals and
  modules. (<a href="/blog/entry/mbed-SDK-is-now-Open-Source/">read

<h2>
  Development Board HDK
</h2>
<p>
  The new mbed Hardware Development Kit (HDK) delivers
  microcontroller sub-system reference designs that can be used as
  the basis for new hardware boards and products, providing a
  simple and consistent building block that benefits from the
  support of the mbed SDK and free online tools. The HDK designs
  specify all major support components including an on-board USB
  interface that enables simple drag-n-drop programming and
  connection to the microcontroller via the USB CMSIS-DAP debug
  interface standard. The design is already used in the official
  mbed Microcontroller prototyping modules, is being adopted by
  mbed partners for low-cost evaluation boards, and is now
  available for download for use in custom designs.
</p>
<h2>
  Free Online Tools
</h2>
<p>
  The mbed Compiler provides a free, powerful, online IDE that is
  powered by the industry standard ARM professional C/C++ compiler,
  pre-configured and tested to generate fast, efficient code
  without fuss. It is fully integrated with the mbed.org developer
  site to enable one-click library imports, and with distributed
  version control for contribution and collaboration for those
  wanting to work together. The mbed Compiler also supports export
  of projects to the major offline toolchains. Combined with the
  portability of the mbed SDK and USB CMSIS-DAP debug interface,
  this allows an easy next step towards product development using
  whichever tool is most appropriate.
</p>
<h2>
  Developer Community
</h2>
<p>
  By basing designs on the mbed Platform, developers adopt a huge
  shared context; that makes it much easier to share questions,
  code, answers and expertise. This has helped mbed grow an active
  and friendly community of skilled developers that are
  collectively helping get products made even faster. Developers
  are sharing thousands of open source repositories and building an
  extensive cookbook of recipes that can be reused to build
  products. The tight integration of distributed version control
  with the online compiler and developer website makes publishing
  and accepting code simple, allowing developers to easily
  collaborate on hard problems, and provides opportunities to
  request or accept contract work to help get things built.
</p>
<h2>
  Getting Started
</h2>
<p>
  The easiest way to get started with the mbed Platform is to order
  an official mbed Microcontroller prototyping board, or look our
  for the imminent arrival of the first mbed-enabled partner
  development boards.
