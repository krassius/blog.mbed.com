<p>
  Asking other mbed users a question, answering those questions and
  being able to learn from previous questions should be getting
  easier. We've just released a beta of our new Question and Answer
  area.

  The new area allows users to post questions which other users can
  vote for. Hopefully voting will mean that interesting questions
  are easier to find.

<p>
  Answers can be posted and the person that posted the question can
  accept an answer. The ability to mark answers as accepted will
  mean that it is easy to see what worked when reading through old
  questions and it means that finding unanswered questions will be
  much easier.

<p>
  The Question and Answers area is currently only available to beta
  users but it's easy to <a href="/betamode">enable beta mode</a>
  if you want to join in. If you're not keen to become a beta
  tester then you can expect to see the new area in the next few
  weeks.
