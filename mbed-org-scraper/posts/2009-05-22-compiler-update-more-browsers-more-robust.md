<p>Some compiler updates for you for your programming pleasure...&#xA0;</p>
<p>The compiler now has a first cut of support for Google Chrome on&#xA0;Windows,
  and Safari on Mac OS X. Whilst there are still a few rough&#xA0;edges,
  I hope you&apos;ll have fun with your new freedom! As always, please&#xA0;shout
  if you spot any problems.&#xA0;</p>
<p>We&apos;ve also implemented a basic retry mechanism in the compiler, with&#xA0;the
  aim of coping with any internet glitches. If something does go&#xA0;wrong
  on a communication, you should be given the option to &quot;retry&quot;,&#xA0;and
  everything should spring back in to life. We&apos;ve made it&#xA0;intentionally
  invasive at the moment so it is obvious a retry has&#xA0;occurred; please
  report if this happens (as with any bugs), as well as&#xA0;whether you
  were able to continue as normal after retrying.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Have Fun!&#xA0;
  <br>Simon</p>
