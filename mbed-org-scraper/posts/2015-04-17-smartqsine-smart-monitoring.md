<p>We love finding new products and projects that have been developed with
  ARM mbed. Our latest find is the <a href="http://www.smartqsine.com/" rel="nofollow">SmartQsine</a> that
  was just released on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/smartqsine-remotely-monitor-your-inventory"
  rel="nofollow">Indiegogo</a>, a device that allows you to track and monitor
  items in your home from your smartphone. For example it could be used to
  track the amount of milk you have left in your fridge, the scale system
  ingeniously designed within the product lets you know when you are almost
  out of milk&#x2026;so you don&#x2019;t have to return from the grocery
  store to only find out that someone drank the last bit of milk!</p>
<p>We got a chance to talk to Uriel Perugia, one of the founders of SmartQsine.
  Their team chose to use the Nordic NRF51822 and mbed for their development
  phase, as they found it to be an easy environment and cost effective platform
  to develop their BLE application. They started by connecting sensors to
  their mbed-based development platform, then utilizing the mbed compiler
  to build the firmware. From their they created a barebones smartphone app
  to test their application. After about 6 months they are now releasing
  their Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p>Check out the video the team created at the ARM Headquarters of the product
  in use!</p>
