<p>The deadline for the Circuit Cellar NXP Design Challenge is under a week
  away...</p>
<p>...and anyone with an mbed can enter!</p>
<p>In case you needed a reminder, they are offering $10,000 in prizes. That
  should focus the mind! I can&apos;t wait to see what some of you come up
  with :)</p>

<p>Don&apos;t leave it to the last minute to get your entries in. It always
  takes longer than you think, so get it in with a few days to spare.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is what my keyring now looks like:</p>

<p>Yep, that is a mbed leatherman :)</p>
<p>Whilst the competition is being run by Circuit Cellar (their decision
  is final), we&apos;ll also be looking out for any entries that are written
  up and published in your notebook after the deadline to share with others;
  catch our eye and stand out as really interesting, wacky, innovative etc
  (all be it in a totally unofficial way), and I might see if I can get a
  couple more of these exclusive <strike>toys</strike> tools made.</p>
<p>Btw, we particularly like videos, so including a YouTube video in your
  writeup is definitely recommended!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
