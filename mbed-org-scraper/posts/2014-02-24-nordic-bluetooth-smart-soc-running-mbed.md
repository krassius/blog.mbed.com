<p>
  Nordic Semiconductor have just announced their new mbed-enabled
  nRF51822-mKIT development kit:
</p>

  alt="/media/uploads/simon/nordic_btsmart2.png" title=
  "/media/uploads/simon/nordic_btsmart2.png"></a>
</p>
<p>
  This kit is based on the Nordic nRF51822 that combines a
  Bluetooth v4.1-compliant radio and an ARM® Cortex®-M0 processor
  along with SPI, I2C, ADC, PWM and GPIO on a single chip. And the
  chip is only about $2 in volume!
</p>
<p>
  Add to the mix that we now successfully have mbed running on it,
  including the Bluetooth Smart APIs we've been adding to the mbed
  SDK, and you now have a really productive way to create a
  Bluetooth Smart based device that can be manufactured incredibly
  cheaply!
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't yet come across Bluetooth Smart, it is quickly
  becoming a key communication component for IoT devices as it is
  already supported in modern smartphones and tablets, and is
  designed for enabling short-range wireless connectivity to things
  like coin cell-powered accessories. This opens the door to things
  like <a href="http://www.nickhunn.com/2ubiquity/" rel=
  "nofollow">Appcessories</a>, but also a whole host of
  applications for interacting and configuring devices, where
  instead of a clunky and expensive embedded UI, you can embed a
  Bluetooth Smart chip, bring your own device (BYOD) and have a
  much cheaper and better user experience.
