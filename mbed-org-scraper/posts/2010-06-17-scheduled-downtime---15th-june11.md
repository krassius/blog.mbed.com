<p>
  To keep up with demand, it is necessary to schedule some mbed
  downtime tomorrow morning (UK time).
</p>
<p>
  We hope for the downtime to last no more than an hour.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What will be affected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  During the downtime the compiler will be unavailable. For part of
  the time, the rest of site will be available, but in a read-only
  state.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why is this downtime necessary?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We will be moving to a new server platform which provides us with
  a lot more disk space and flexibility. The downtime on this
  occasion is due to the time needed to copy all the data across to
  the new servers.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your understanding and continued support!
