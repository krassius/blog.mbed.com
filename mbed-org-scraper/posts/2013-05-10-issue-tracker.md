<p>We are pleased to announce the introduction of an issue tracker for every
  mbed code repository (libraries and programs).</p>
<div style="padding: 10px; float:right">
  <p>
    <img src="https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/emilmont/issues.png"
    alt="/media/uploads/emilmont/issues.png" title="/media/uploads/emilmont/issues.png">
  </p>
</div>
<p>This new feature is switched off on repositories by default; to enable
  it on your code repository, just tick the &quot;<strong><em>Enable issue tracking</em></strong>&quot;
  checkbox in the &quot;<strong><em>Admin settings</em></strong>&quot;:</p>

</p>
<p>We&apos;ve included a very important field in the form for reporting an
  issue: the &quot;<strong><em>URL to testcase program</em></strong>&quot;.
  Through this field you can provide a minimal test case reproducing the
  problem to the library maintainers, making it easier to find and fix problems.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a great way to track issue and feature requests on
  libraries, and make it even easier to improve the code quality of libraries
  published on mbed.org.</p>
<p>We have already enabled the issue tracker for all the <a href="/users/mbed_official/code/">mbed official code repositories</a>.
  If you have issues related to these, please add a ticket. Also, if in the
  past you reported an issue in the forums or in a comment, that has perhaps
  not been noticed, it&apos;d be great if you could add it here so it doesn&apos;t
  get missed. On the official mbed libraries, we will certainly give higher
  priority to the issues that have been reported with a testcase program,
  so it is a great habit to get into.</p>
