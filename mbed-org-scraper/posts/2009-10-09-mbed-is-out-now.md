<p>Morning from ESC Farnborough,</p>
<p>In case you hadn&apos;t guessed, mbed is now official! We turned on the
  website and showed mbed off publicly for the first time at ESC Boson a
  couple of weeks ago, and got a really great response. Thanks to everyone
  who came and visited at the stand, and for all the support.</p>

<p>The really great news is that the mbed Microcontroller is now available
  for pre-order in Digikey and Farnell (see the <a href="/order">order page</a>).
  The price these guys are putting it out for is impressive, and the demand
  has been higher than we could have imagined, so we&apos;re making more
  batches as fast as we can! The lead time for orders is totally based on
  supply vs. demand at the moment, and could be up to 6-weeks, but it is
  basically first come, first served. As long as you know that and you are
  happy, please go ahead and order one!</p>

</ul>
<p>On a final note, our twittering billy bass demo was also a bit of a hit
  :) I&apos;ll make sure we write that up properly and give him the credit
  he is due.</p>
<p>We&apos;re now looking forward to seeing what projects people are planning,
  and working on mbed to improve it to make it even easier for you to try
  them out!</p>
<p>Thanks,
  <br>Simon (on behalf of everyone on the mbed Team)</p>
