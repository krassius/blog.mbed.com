<p>
  It's has been a busy few months here at mbed, here's a wrap up of
  a few interesting things that have been happening with mbed -
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaboration beta Trials
  </li>
  <li>Automated Heating Controller using Google Calendar
  </li>
  <li>NEW NFC Stack for mbed
  </li>
  <li>UK SMART Grants for Prototype to Product
  </li>
  <li>Beta Testers Wanted - 3G Mobile Internet
  </li>
  <li>Live Webinar : Rapid Prototype &amp;amp; Development of USB
  Connected Devices Using mbed and LPCXpresso
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Collaboration beta Trials
</h2>
<p>
  We're introducing fully integrated support for code collaboration
  within the mbed Compiler and Website. Using distributed version
  control model (DVCS), will allow creation, sharing and
  collaboration on code repositories and we're looking for a group
  of developers that are interested in testing these features on a
  shared library or project. <a href=

<h2>
  Automated Heating Controller using Google Calendar
</h2>
<p>
  Every now and again there is a home automation hack that seems
  like it might be something you'd want to implement in your own
  home. In this project, a developer uses an mbed to control a
  heater based on events in set in a Google Calendar. <a href=

<h2>
  NEW NFC Stack for mbed
</h2>
<p>
  Yep that's right, NFC for mbed! Donatien Garnier of AppNearMe has
  written the µNFC Stack for mbed, allowing developers to interface
  mbed to the NXP PN532 NFC Controller The stack allows you to
  build your own NFC-enabled hardware, and interface the AppNearMe
  framework for Android devices, allowing you to focus on building
  your feature-rich app that compliments your device. <a href=

<h2>
  UK SMART Grants for Prototype to Product
</h2>
<p>
  Ashley Evans of the Electronic Technology Networks has contacted
  us about SMART Grants, and we think they might be of interest to
  the UK based mbed developers. An mbed user developing a
  commercial product could be eligible for a funding up to 60% of
  their R&amp;amp;D cost. <a href=

<h2>
  Beta Testers Wanted - 3G Mobile Internet
</h2>
<p>
  Join us in testing the new libraries we've created for
  interfacing the LPC1768 mbed to a Vodafone K3770 USB 3G internet
  dongle. Beta testing is already under way, and you can find more
  information and the library on the cookbook page. We've also
  setup a forum thread for all questions, bug reports and feature
  suggestions. So if you've been dreaming about a remote
  internet-connected application, why not begin your mbed + 3G
  prototype today! <a href=

  Live Webinar : Rapid Prototype &amp;amp; Development of USB
  Connected Devices Using mbed and LPCXpresso
</h2>
<p>
  Jim Carver (Avnet Electronics) and Paul Boogaards (NXP
  Semiconductors), two specialists in microcontrollers and embedded
  development, are going to present a free live webinar on Tuesday
  June 26th, about rapid prototyping with MCUs including a
  walk-through of adding USB connectivity to designs using the NXP
  LPC11U24. <a href=
