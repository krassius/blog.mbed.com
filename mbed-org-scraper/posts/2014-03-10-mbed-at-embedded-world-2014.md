<p>The mbed ecosystem has been growing rapidly and we are excited about all
  of our new Partners. The ARM onsite film team was able to catch up with
  a few of them at <a href="http://www.embedded-world.de/en/" rel="nofollow">Embedded World (EW)</a> last
  week. If you missed all the news last week, check out the videos below
  to get the latest updates.</p>

 <h2>STMicroelectronics</h2>

<p>STMicroelectronics <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/STMicroelectronics-mbed-enabled-Nucleo/">announced their new STM32 Nucleo Development Board</a> just
  before EW. This ARM Cortex&#xAE;-M based board allows developers to build
  prototypes with ease and flexibility. As an mbed enabled platform developers
  can freely compile and take advantage of software libraries online. Watch
  the video to find out more and you can also see how easy to use the STMicroelectronics&#x2019;s
  Nucleo board is in <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/Hands-on-ST-Nucleo-board-with-a-shield/">Mihail&#x2019;s Hand-on blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Nordic Semiconductor</h2>

  <p>At EW <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/Nordic-Bluetooth-Smart-SoC-running-mbed/">Nordic Semiconductor announced their new mbed-enabled nRF51822-mKIT</a> that
    combines a Bluetooth v4.1-compliant radio and an ARM Cortex-M0 processor
    along with SPI, I2C, ADC, PWM and GPIO on a single chip. Find out here
    how you can use mbed BLE APIs to easily implement a Bluetooth LE Health
    Thermometer. In the video below Thomas Ulleberg from Nordic discusses how
    he thinks this will bring &#x201C;Bluetooth LE to the masses.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>u-blox</h2>

    <p>Herbert Blaser from u-blox&#x2019;s talks about their recent collaborations
      with ARM and how they are making development of communication modules easier
      with the mbed platform.</p>

<h2>ARM &amp; IoT</h2>

    <p>Last but not least they captured ARM&apos;s EVP and GM of the IoT Business
      Unit, John Cornish, thoughts about Sensinode &amp; mbed&apos;s role in
      the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) market.</p>

<h2>CSR</h2>

    <p>Another noteworthy mention is <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140226006179/en#.UxinFoVRYkY"
      rel="nofollow">CSR announcing their partnership with ARM</a> to bring connectivity
      &amp; GPS solutions to the mbed community, &quot;The partnership provides
      the mbed community access to CSR Bluetooth&#xAE;, Bluetooth Smart, Wi-Fi&#xAE;
      and GPS connectivity solutions and makes it easy for them to be integrated
      into existing microcontroller projects.&quot;</p>
    
<h2>Freescale</h2>

    <p>Additionally more mbed support is being added to Freescale&#x2019;s Freedom
      microcontroller platform line with the <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/FRDM-KL05Z-ARM-Cortex-M0/">FRDM-KL05Z</a>.
      This is ultra-low-cost development platform is enabled by the Kinetis L
      Series KL0x MCU family built on the ARM Cortex-M0+ processor.</p>
    <p>Looks like 2014 is off to a great start, and we are looking forward to
      growing the mbed ecosystem further!</p>
