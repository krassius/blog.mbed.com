  Have you seen the recent Kickstarter, <a href=
  "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/donatien-garnier/micronfcboard-easy-nfc-for-the-internet-of-things"
  rel="nofollow">MicroNFCBoard</a>? Well the creator is one of
  mbed’s very own, <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/users/donatien/">Donatien Garnier</a>. Donatien
  is a former mbed intern (from about 4 years back) and active mbed
  community member. I got a chance to met him at our team bbq in
  Cambridge just a few weeks ago and got a close up look at his new
  Kickstarter project!
</p>
<p>
  MicroNFCBoard is an mbed-enabled board with Near Field
  Communication (NFC) functionality and it makes it really easy to
  use all three NFC modes (tag reading/write, tag emulation and
  Android Beam/P2P). It contains a NFC transceiver, a
  microcontroller and all the software you need to use NFC. The
  board features a NXP LPC11U34 microcontroller based on an ARM
  Cortex-M0 and a bunch of peripherals.

  Donatien said, most people only think of NFC technology for
  payment applications, but in reality it has the potential for
  many more functionalities and applications. He saw an opportunity
  to create an NFC-enabled developer board that integrates a simple
  user interface, so that it is easier for developers to use this
  ultra low-power technology. To improve the use interface, he
  created the AppNearMe mode, so that you can view your device’s
  inputs and control its outputs through the NFC-enabled Android
  app.

  The MicroNFCBoard will be supported on mbed after its official
  release, so lets make sure Donatien hits his funding goal. Show
  them your support by signing up to get your own <a href=
  "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/donatien-garnier/micronfcboard-easy-nfc-for-the-internet-of-things"
  rel="nofollow">MicroNFCBoard</a>. They are about £40 currently,
  but I am sure that price range won’t last long.
