  components together in a concrete UFO?</p>

<p>We travelled to the&#xA0;<a href="http://www.elektormedia.com/elektorlive/">Elektor Live!</a> show
  this weekend, which was being hosted at Evoluon in Eindoven, The Netherlands.
  Here is what it looks like from the outside:</p>

<p>As part of Elektor Live!, Wisse @ Elektor had invited us to run an mbed
  workshop. When I said yes&#xA0;I think we were expecting maybe 15-20 places.
  It turns out 75 people signed up before they stopped accepting people!
  Here is everyone, ready to go:</p>

<p>We wanted to run the workshop as a hands-on, allowing everyone to experiment
  with new things and at their own pace. We had already had the idea of putting
  together a workshop kit of interesting parts, with of all sorts of Sparkfun
  breakouts and bits for people to play with. Turns out we had to make 4
  in the end :)</p>
<p>Here are the four boxes I put together on thursday, almost complete and
  ready for the workshop. Primarily Sparkfun breakout board like accelerometers,
  gyros, screens, sensors, trackballs, rfid readers, ...</p>

<p>I think pretty much everything got used once.</p>
<p>And for completeness,&#xA0;here is the presentation I used to introduce
  the workshop:</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who took part!&#xA0;It was excellent to see so many
  people experimenting and getting this running so quickly. The feedback
  was really good too, so we think we&apos;ve got a great recipe for a workshop.</p>
<p>If you think there would be enough interest to run a workshop like this
  near you, give us a shout here or on twitter! Especially if you want to
  hep run it :)</p>
