<p>By the end of the workshop you should be :</p>
<p>- Familar with the mbed microcontroller, its online tools and developer
  website</p>
<p>- Able to use the mbed libraries to rapidly prototype using Digital IO,
  I2C, A/D, D/A, Interrupts, and more!</p>
<p>- Creating working rapid prototypes that include high level functional&#xA0;blocks
  such as&#xA0;SDCard, USB Host and Ethernet.</p>
