<p></p>
<p>The compiler has just had some minor updates...&#xA0;</p>
<p>As requested by a few people, the compiler now supports a &quot;Compile-And-Download&quot;
  button. It should help make things a little more clear, and&#xA0;combined
  with the fact we&apos;ve added keyboard shortcuts, a little faster&#xA0;too
  (e.g. Ctrl-D).&#xA0;</p>
<p>We&apos;ve also removed a bottleneck that was causing saves to be sluggish,&#xA0;improved
  some of the import support, and added a few other features&#xA0;and fixes.&#xA0;</p>
<p>If you see any bad behaviour or bugs, please make sure you email us at&#xA0;support@mbed.co.uk.&#xA0;</p>
<p></p>
