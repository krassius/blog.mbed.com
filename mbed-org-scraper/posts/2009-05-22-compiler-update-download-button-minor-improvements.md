<p>
  The compiler has just had some minor updates...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  As requested by a few people, the compiler now supports a
  "Compile-And-Download" button. It should help make things a
  little more clear, and&nbsp;combined with the fact we've added
  keyboard shortcuts, a little faster&nbsp;too (e.g. Ctrl-D).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We've also removed a bottleneck that was causing saves to be
  sluggish,&nbsp;improved some of the import support, and added a
  few other features&nbsp;and fixes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  If you see any bad behaviour or bugs, please make sure you email
  us at&nbsp;support@mbed.co.uk.&nbsp;
</p>
