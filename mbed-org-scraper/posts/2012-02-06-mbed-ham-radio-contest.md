  is an active ham radio operator. He contacted us last year with an idea
  to run a competition to explore how microcontrollers could be applied to
  ham radio applications. It sounded like a great idea, so we sponsored him
  with a bit of mbed kit for prizes and in conjunction with the publication
  &quot;QSP Revue&quot;, a competition was born. Here is a great summary
  from Luc of the results of what became the first &quot;QSP Revue mbed Ham
  Radio Contest&quot;</p>

<p>There are currently millions of ham radio (amateur radio) users around
  the world. These fellows are motivated by all techniques and technologies
  that enhance all forms of radio communications.</p>

<h3>The Contest</h3>

<p>Belgian French Radio Amateur publication <a href="http://www.on6ll.be/NMRevue/NMRevue.htm"
  rel="nofollow">QSP Revue</a> ran a contest, sponsored by mbed and Plantronics,
  to use an mbed microcontroller in a ham radio application.</p>
<p>Contestants were asked to submit a proposal for a project suitable for
  a ham application. A jury of independent amateur radio users judged the
  feasibility and appropriateness of the project and the most appealing proposals
  received an mbed to develop their projects. The contestants were also required
  to produce all the necessary documentation to allow other ham fellows to
  produce their own prototypes of the described application.</p>
 <h3>The Finalists</h3>

<p>DTMF Generator - A solution to control specific ham radio applications
  (Web communication, radio relay control) using sound signals such as those
  used in telephony. <a href="http://www.on6ll.be/NMRevue/2011/QSP-revue_052011.pdf"

<p>OUFTI1- A cubesat (10x10x10 cm satellite) housing a DSTAR communication
  satellite communication relay. This was an academic project supported by
  ESA (European Space Agency). This project was aimed at deciphering the
  OUFTI1 data stream affected by the Doppler Effect (a frequency shift due
  to moving objects).

<p>CW-Box - A dedicated communication switching system that implements the
  appropriate switching delays in various communication equipment configurations.

<h3>The Winner</h3>

<p>DSTAR Decoder - An mbed-based protocol conversion system to decode the
  DSTAR protocol which is usually only supported by one manufacturer. This
  allows standard ham transceiver equipment to transmit and receive digital
  voice, data and images via this protocol. The project not only achieved
  efficient support of the DSTAR protocol, it also opens this communication
  channel through existing and cheaper means.<a href="http://www.on6ll.be/NMRevue/2011/QSP-revue_062011.pdf"

<p>Although the number of projects was limited by restricted C/C++ programming
  knowledge, the contest has generated plenty of interesting content in the
  QSP Revue throughout the year. When the OUFTI1 satellite is operational
  (launch expected end of this year), interest in DSTAR communication will
  rise and the offered mbed solutions will lead to more implementations and
  discoveries in this field.</p>
