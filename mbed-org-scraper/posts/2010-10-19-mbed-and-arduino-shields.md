  Hack-a-day described mbed as "Arduino. On steroids. With claws
  and fangs.". The Arduino is a great platform and has rightly
  built up a strong following of tinkerers. What it has also done
  is stimulated a lot of bolt-on technologies to become accessible
  in the form of "shields". Well, it seems someone has been busy
  making a breakout to let the power of mbed loose on any of these
  great shields too...

  No idea of the specs or who is behind it. Anyone in the know want
  to share any more details?!
