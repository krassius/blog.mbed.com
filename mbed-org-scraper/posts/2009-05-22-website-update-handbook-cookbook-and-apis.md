<p>Whilst we&apos;ve introduced most of these updates in stages over the
  last few weeks, I thought it&apos;d be worth making them official!&#xA0;</p>
<p>The basics of the Handbook are in place now at http://mbed.co.uk/handbook.&#xA0;This
  is going to be the main guide for the introductions and core mbed&#xA0;apis/features.
  Hopefully the introductions are good to get people&#xA0;started, and we&apos;ll
  be concentrating on where you go next; any&#xA0;suggestions for what you&apos;d
  like to see welcome!&#xA0;</p>
<p>We moved over to a &quot;Cookbook&quot; area which is open for anyone
  to add to.&#xA0;It has a wiki and code repository, and we&apos;d encourage
  people to share&#xA0;projects and notes, especially the process you go
  through making them.&#xA0;We&apos;ve noticed the blog-like style works
  well as not only does it show&#xA0;the answer, but also how you got there.
  This seems a great way to help&#xA0;others learn, get suggestions, etc.
  Go nuts!&#xA0;</p>
<p>We&apos;ve also implemented auto-documentation for our libraries (using
  the&#xA0;very elegant NaturalDocs). Still some integration improvements
  that&#xA0;haven&apos;t quite made it in yet, but getting it in there means
  we can&#xA0;start worrying about improving the documentation. And we thought
  it&#xA0;might be useful to others too, so it is also available in the&#xA0;Cookbook.
  Any code checked in to the cookbook repository gets&#xA0;documentation
  generated from it if present, so feel free to experiment&#xA0;yourself
  with your own code.&#xA0;</p>
