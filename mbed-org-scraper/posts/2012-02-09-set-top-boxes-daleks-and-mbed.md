  UK media broadcaster BBC, has an active R&amp;D department
  charged with exploring technologies that will benefit their
  public viewer audience. A team of their engineers have developed
  a specification for the <a href=
  "http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP194.pdf"
  rel="nofollow">Universal Control API</a> for embedded platforms,
  which is designed to allow the core functionality of any
  network-connected set-top box, personal video recorder, Internet
  radio or similar device to be controlled from client software
  running on another device on the home network.

  So what does this have to do with mbed?

  Well, BBC Industrial Trainee placement Andrew Bonney demonstrated
  the Universal Control API by building an mbed-based TV-controlled
  Dalek which synchronises with a particular Dr Who episode and
  mimics the onscreen cyborg. The Dalek prototype, equipped with an
  mbed and Wi-Fi module, communicates real time with an
  experimental set-top box hosting the Universal Control API in
  order to synchronise the movement.
</p>
<p>
  The project is described in the <a href=
  "http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/researchanddevelopment/2011/11/tv-controlled-daleks---not-com.shtml"
  rel="nofollow"><strong>BBC R&amp;D blog</strong></a>; you should
  be able to spot a few references to the mbed microcontroller in
  the video.

  place working on another mbed-based project with the team at the
  BBC!
