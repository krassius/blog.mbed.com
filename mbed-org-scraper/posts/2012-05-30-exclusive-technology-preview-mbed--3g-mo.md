<p>
  mbed have been working on libraries to allow developers to
  prototype microcontroller-based machine to machine (M2M) and
  ‘Internet of Things’ applications that communicate over the 3G
  mobile network.

  Developers will soon be able to build embedded applications using
  APIs that allow the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC1768">mbed LPC1768
  Microcontroller</a> to communicate over 3G using standard web
  protocols, enabling focus on applications rather than low-level
  implementation.
</p>
<p>
  The APIs will facilitate interfacing the mbed to the <a href=
  "http://shop.vodafone.co.uk/shop/mobile-broadband-devices/internet-dongle-K3770-payg"
  rel="nofollow">Vodafone K3770 USB Dongle</a>, presenting a
  simplified approach to accessing mobile internet. Where
  traditional approaches require expensive 3G Modems, complex
  software stacks or in-depth knowledge of the mobile transport,
  this platform presents a productive prototyping solution aimed at
  getting things done.
</p>
<h3>
  Beta Testing Program
</h3>
<p>
  mbed are seeking an select set of developers to assist with
  testing the mbed + 3G platform before official public release.
  Currently the program is available for UK residence only, with
  the aim to have stable libraries available for the public within
  the coming months.
</p>
<p>
  If you’d like to take part in the beta program, or would like to
  find out more about the platform, visit <strong><a href=

  We’re going to be at <a href="http://overtheair.org" rel=

  demonstrate the platform. So if you are planning to be there, and
  you want an exclusive preview of the APIs make sure you catch the
  three mbed and Vodafone sessions!
