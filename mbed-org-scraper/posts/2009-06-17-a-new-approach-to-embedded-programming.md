<p>Check it out! Tom Cantrell of Circuit Cellar got hold of one of our prototype
  mbed Microcontrollers, and he has written an article! It is called
  <span
  class="style16">Easy (E)mbed</span>- An Alternative Approach to Embedded Programming.
    That means mbed is in print!</p>

</p>
<p>UPDATE: It is in the June #227 issue, which you can buy online at <a href="http://www.mygazines.com/issue/988">http://www.mygazines.com/issue/988</a>.
  You can also read just this article if you go to the bottom of <a href="http://www.circuitcellar.com/magazine/">http://www.circuitcellar.com/magazine/</a>,
  where there is a pdf with corrections from the printed article.</p>
<p>Looks like it might be time to start openning up the mbed Beta :) If you
  know people who might be interested in getting involved, you can now point
  them at <a href="/beta">http://mbed.co.uk/beta</a>.</p>
<p>Great stuff!</p>
