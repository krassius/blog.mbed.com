<p>Good news!</p>
<p>We have been hard at work over the past couple of months, and tomorrow
  morning (28th August, GMT/UTC) we will be implementing a major upgrade
  of the mbed website.</p>
<p>You will notice a few differences; most notably the&#xA0;mbed domain will
  change to mbed.org as opposed to mbed.co.uk, though the latter will still
  work.&#xA0;There will also be a fair few behind the scenes changes, such
  as moving to a shiny new server farm.</p>
<p>While we implement the changes and transfer the site to its new home,
  the website will be unavailable. It shouldn&apos;t take more than a couple
  of hours to complete the move.&#xA0;I will try and keep you updated on
  the move progress at&#xA0;<a href="http://twitter.com/mbedmicro">http://twitter.com/mbedmicro</a> .</p>
<p>After the move is complete, your feedback would be much appreciated, in
  the forum if possible. This is an essential upgrade ahead of opening the
  site to the general public, which will happen within a week or two, so
  if you find anything broken or unclear, let us know! There will doubtless
  be some wrinkles to be ironed out after the move, so please bear with us.</p>
<p>Finally, I have taken the liberty of turning on site update email notification
  for all beta testers. If for any reason you wish to opt out of receiving
  these emails, just untick the box in the My Account area (<a href="/accounts/profile/">http://mbed.co.uk/accounts/profile/</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
