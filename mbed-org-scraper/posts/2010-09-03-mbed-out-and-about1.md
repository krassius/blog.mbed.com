<p>I was adding some mbed events to our calander and realised we&apos;ve
  actually got quite a lot coming up this next month or so. I thought it&apos;d
  be worth capturing where we&apos;ll be incase any of you mbed early-adopters
  can come and say hi, or any newbies want to find out what mbed is all about!
  Here is what is coming up...</p>
<p><strong>E-KTN Workshop, September 14th, Portsmouth UK</strong>
</p>
<p>The UK&apos;s Electronics Knowledge Transfer Network (E-KTN) will be running
  another one day mbed workshop, after the success of the first one. Here
  is the blurb:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&quot;The focus of the E-KTN is to help electronics make its way into
  other industries, and keep the electronics industry up up to date with
  the latest developments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day includes some presentations about mbed Rapid Prototyping technology,
  walkthrough examples of setting up and using mbed, and a free form lab
  to experiment with the kit in the safety of the workshop environment.&quot;</p>
<p

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open Hardware Summit, September 23rd, New York USA</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">We&apos;ll be at the Open Hardware Summit where there should be lots of
    great talk about open hardware and how to help enable it. Really looking
    forward to this, and seeing what ideas are flying about. Hopefully will
    be able to add some ideas/experience, and meet some interesting people
    too!</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">See the site for it at <a href="http://www.openhardwaresummit.org/">Open Hardware Summit</a>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>World Maker Faire, September 25th/26th, New York USA</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">First time making it over to a US maker faire! We should have a small
    table somewhere where you can sit down and play with mbed if you haven&apos;t
    already, come and show us what you&apos;ve been up to, or talk about your
    ideas of how to make mbed better. Come and find us and have a chat. When
    we&apos;re not busy looking at all the other amazing stuff that&apos;ll
    be there :)</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NI Days 2010, November 9th, London UK</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">We&apos;ve been doing some work on hooking mbed up to National Instruments
    LabView, and getting some great results. As a result, we&apos;ve now been
    invited to present at the NI Days conference in London, so will be working
    hard to get this all polished up and hopefully make a great addition to
    the tools available to quickly experiment.</p>

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ARM Technology Conference 2010, November 9th-11th, Santa Clara USA</strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">We&apos;ll be demoing something at the ARM tech con based around mbed.
    Not going to give away too many details yet (as it is not built, so we
    don&apos;t know the details yet!), but it will involve robots we think!</p>
  <p
  style="text-align: justify;">This is a great event to see all sorts of upcoming ARM technology, from
    the newest microcontrollers through to top end apps processors destined
    for the next generation of phones/tablets, and some pretty awesome 3D graphics
    technology that will be ending up in future devices too. If you are around,
    worth a drop in.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Elektor Live!, November 20th, Eindhoven The Netherlands</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Elektor have invited us to run a morning Experts Training Workshop which
      i&apos;ll be running at Elektor Live!, to let you get your hands on mbed
      and have a play, work through some examples (and even take home the hardware
      afterwards). This sounds like it&apos;ll be a very hands-on conference
      that should be of great interest for people who like to talk tech and get
      their hands dirty, so I&apos;m really looking forward to this one.</p>
    <p
    style="text-align: justify;">For the workshop, you need to sign up so take a look at the Expert Training
      page on <a href="http://www.elektorlive.nl/">http://www.elektorlive.nl/</a>:</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Phew! There you go for now. Looks like it&apos;ll be a busy few months.</p>
        <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Hope to see you at one of these events!</p>
