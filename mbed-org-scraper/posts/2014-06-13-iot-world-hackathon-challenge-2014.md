<p>ARM, Avnet and Freescale are hosting a <a href="http://iotworldevent.com/hack/"
  rel="nofollow">Hackathon</a> at the <a href="http://iotworldevent.com/" rel="nofollow">IoT World Event</a> next
  week (June 17-18) in Palo Alto, California at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. Our
  hackathon challenge is to build on from the other IoT World Hackathon Challenges
  that should produce some compelling consumer and environmental IoT innovations.
  We want our hackathon participants to think outside the box and create
  projects which are interoperable with other teams; where at least part
  of your application works with part of an application from one (or more)
  of the other teams.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in this event, register <a href="http://iotworldevent.com/register/"

<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong>
</p>
<p>ARM, Avnet, and Freescale are sponsoring the hardware, software, and technical
  assistance for our hackathon. A number of WiFi enabled Wi-Go Microcontroller
  + sensor platforms will be provided by Avnet. The ARM&#xAE; mbed&#x2122;
  web IDE for embedded devices will be provided for drag-and-drop software
  module composition and programming of the Wi-Go modules, using mbed sensor
  and communication libraries.</p>
<p>The ARM Sensinode&#x2122; platform connects the devices to web applications
  using CoAP and OMA LWM2M IoT standard protocols. Standard protocols and
  web objects enable interoperability between sensor devices and web applications
  through the ARM Sensinode platform.</p>
<p>An example demo application will be provided to enable participants to
  start off with an end-to-end connection and a hackable sample application.
  ARM will provide technical assistance to help participants use the Wi-Go
  system, mbed, and the ARM Sensinode Platform. The interoperability challenge
  is for building applications that work with applications from other teams.</p>
