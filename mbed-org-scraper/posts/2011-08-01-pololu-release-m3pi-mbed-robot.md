<p>
  Pololu have just released an mbed-based 3pi robot. Take a look at
  this:

</p>
<p>
  These robots are great; very fast, and nice and robust too. And
  now with the power of mbed and peripherals like the USB Host
  interface, this should make it a superb platform for AI and
  wireless remote control robot experiments, whether you want to
  get deeply in to embedded code or just remote control it from
  your favourite PC language.
</p>
<p>
  A component to note is the USB-A socket; this connects to the
  mbed USB host, and means you can plug in USB Disks (e.g. for
  route instructions) or even USB bluetooth dongles for wireless
  remote control via PC, Phone or even Wii Remote:

    m3pi with a Wii Remote</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You can even control the robot over bluetooth using RPC (Remote
  Procedure Calls), allowing it to be controlled from a PC using
  your favourite programing language without having to write any
  embedded code:

  You can see all the features of the board here:

  This platform should have lots of possibilities. For more
  details, see the mbed Cookbook page and the Pololu website:

  Looking forward to seeing how this gets used!
