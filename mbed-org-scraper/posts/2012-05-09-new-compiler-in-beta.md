<p>
  The latest mbed compiler is now available in beta!
</p>
<p>
  This release primarily has behind the scenes changes and
  bugfixes, but there's one improvement you should definitely
  notice: <strong>speed!</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We have added incremental compilation support, which means that
  when compiling large programs, subsequent recompiles will be much
  faster, only recompiling those files which have changed. There's
  also performance improvements to the UI in several areas.
</p>
<p>
  Try it out at <a href="http://mbed.org/betamode/">betamode</a>
  and please let us know what you think and report any bugs in the
  <a href="http://mbed.org/forum/bugs-suggestions/">usual
  place</a>. We'll aim to roll out the new version to all users in
  the next week or two.
</p>
