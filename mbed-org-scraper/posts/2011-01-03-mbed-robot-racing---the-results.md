<p>After 2 days of highly&#xA0;competitive&#xA0;racing at ARM Tech Con 2010.
  The results are ready to be announced.</p>
<p>In true award ceremony style, there are few people to thank. Firstly,
  <a
  href="http://mbed.org/users/Lykos1986/">Ioannis Kedros</a>, for putting together a great PCB design so quickly,
    then for hand manufacturing the required number of units to take to Tech
    Con. Secondly, the guys from <a href="http://www.pololu.com" target="_blank"
    title="Pololu">Pololu</a> who came along to Tech Con and helped out&#xA0;enormously.
    Thanks!</p>
<p>So without further ado, the winners were :</p>

<p>Well done to all you guys for your hard work!</p>
<p>The really interesting thing from the event was just how close the leader
  board was, and how the winners went about securing their first place.</p>
<p>Sivayya, who recorded the third fastets lap time to secure second place,
  was just 238ms ahead of the tenth fastest lap time that earned Eric third
  place. (Take a look at&#xA0;<a href="http://mbed.org/robotracing/event/armtechcon/">http://mbed.org/robotracing/event/armtechcon</a> ).
  Sivayya spent quite some time carefully honing his PID control algorithm
  that slowly converged on his time of 4.442s.</p>
<p>The real surprise was that Minh and Ionels winning time&#xA0;didn&apos;t&#xA0;come
  from a PID controlled m3pi, but an open loop controlled robot using LOGO
  style commands to describe the fastest route around the track. While Sivayyas
  m3pi diligently followed the line around the centre of the track, Minh
  and Ionels m3pi navigated the shortest possible route, using painstakingly
  crafted series of motor control commands!</p>
<p>So one final &quot;congratulations&quot; to the winners and &quot;thank
  you&quot; to the helpers, and I&apos;ll leave you with a few photos from
  the event.</p>
