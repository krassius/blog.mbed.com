  Circuit Cellar have announced the results of the mbed NXP Design
  Challenge!
</p>
<p>
  Well done to Hexley Ball who won first place with his smart
  electronic load; a really impressive bit of kit using just about
  every interface on the mbed to provide amazing levels of
  functionality, all very professionally executed with a superb
  writeup!

  This was apparently the biggest response Circuit Cellar have ever
  had to a design competition, so well done to everyone who took
  part! I know there were some amazing entries that didn't get a
  mention as the competition was so tough and the judging strict on
  full write-ups, so please share your work on the site so others
  can benefit from all the hard work you put in!
