<p>
  Oliver over at ELMICRO told me about a great new board they've
  put out for mbed. Meet the mbed TestBed!
</p>

<p>
  Looks like a great platform for easy access to all the signals.
  Here are all the details from ELMICRO:
</p>
<p>
  "TestBed is a versatile carrier board for the mbed
  microcontroller module. The TestBed provides interfaces for
  RS485, RS232-TTL, CAN and Ethernet as well as an XBee socket
  which grants access to the ever-growing family of wireless
  communication modules being available in the popular XBee form
  factor. It also provides the necessary power supply circuitry and
  a 100mil-spaced prototyping area, and even a socket for Arduino
  shields!"
</p>
<p>
  You can also get it as a complete starter kit with mbed and
  TestBed, a white-on-blue 20x4 alphanumeric LC display, cables,
  connectors and mounting material plus a wall plug power supply
  unit. You can find out all the details at:
