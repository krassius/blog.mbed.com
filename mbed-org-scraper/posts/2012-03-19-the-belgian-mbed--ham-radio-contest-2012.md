    <br>A Belgian radio club in Jambes ON6NR, together with <a href="http://www.bytecom.be/"
    rel="nofollow">BYTECOM</a> - an ARM representative in Belgium have organised
    the second official mbed Ham Radio Contest. The objective is to develop
    and document an innovative design with the mbed Microcontroller for use
    in an amateur radio application.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>Each contestant must provide a project description including the motivation
    behind the project, the circuitry &amp; associated peripherals and an outline/block
    diagram of the program (in C/C++, <a href="http://jumentum.sourceforge.net"
    rel="nofollow">Basic for mbed</a> or any other available solution). Submissions
    must be sent to either <u>on5fm@uba.be</u> or <u>on5fm@dommel.be</u> no later
    than <u>12am (GMT) 22nd April 2012</u>. A jury of ham operators, embedded
    specialists and engineers will review proposals for concept quality, possibility
    of realisation, reproducibility, interest and usability. It will not necessarily
    be the most impressive proposals that will be selected, so all participants
    have an opportunity to win! The top ten projects submitted will all receive
    a free mbed Microcontroller to build their project. The projects not selected,
    are still invited to participate but will be required to obtain their own
    mbed.</p>
  <p>The final project reports should be submitted via abovementioned e-mail,
    no later than <u>12am (GMT) 30th June 2012</u>. It is a requirement for
    all projects to be operational and duly documented including, a technical
    article (in French), a video (i.e.YouTube), jpeg images and any other material
    to confirm the effective functionality of the project. The winners list
    will be published in QSP Revue August edition. The winners will receive
    a prize offered by the sponsors of the competition and a prize ceremony
    is planned for September 2012.</p>
  <p>Projects will be published in the French amateur radio publication &#x201C;QSP
    Revue&#x201D;, therefore text and descriptions associated with the project <u>must</u> be
    published in French. The editor of QSP revue will provide some assistance
    to correct and review the contributions to fit the publication.</p>
  <p>As usual with Ham radio initiatives, everything is free of charge. Apart
    from investigating the use of ARM 32-bit microcontrollers in Ham applications,
    one of the main objectives is to provide QSP Revue with quality articles,
    therefore project authors will accept copyright resignation and free of
    charge publishing of their contribution. Although the QSP Revue practice
    is not to accept advertising, the editor may accept some commercial text
    advertisements from project sponsors, if deemed allowable.</p>
  
<h3>2011 Winner</h3>

  <p>The first prize last year was won by Xavier (ON5XAW) a student at the
    University of Li&#xE8;ge (Belgium). Xavier implemented a versatile solution
    to permit digital communication using the D-STAR protocol associated to
    the Cubesat Project: Oufti-1.

  <p><u>The D-STAR Protocol</u>
The D-STAR protocol was developed by Japan Amateur
    Radio League to combine voice, data and video in a digital streaming protocol.
    D-STAR is currently able to establish radio links between portable transceivers
    via radio relays or connect via the internet. The Oufti-1 project implemented
    at the University of Li&#xE8;ge is a world first; it is a functional miniature
    satellite (10cm cube) developed by students completing their Masters in
    Applied Science degrees, housing the electronics of a D-STAR satellite
    relay. The project is sponsored by the ESA and the launch of <a href="http://www.leodium.ulg.ac.be/cmsms/"
    rel="nofollow">OUFTI-1</a> is expected in the course of this year.</p>
  <p>Connecting with an orbiting satellite is not straightforward since the
    signal is affected by a frequency shift caused by the Doppler Effect. The
    D-STAR compatible transceivers sold by ICOM have technical limitations
    that are affected by this shift. Xavier&#x2019;s project intends to offer
    Ham radio amateurs the ability to connect with OUFTI-1 while it orbits
    above the horizon. Further to this, the mbed/D-STAR module will not only
    solve the Doppler Effect restriction, but it will also allow most digitally
    enabled transceivers - not D-STAR compatible -to communicate with other
    D-STAR partners via terrestrial ways. In other words, it will motivate
    Ham around the world to actively participate in D-STAR communications and
    more interestingly with the soon to be launched OUFTI-1 experiment.</p>
  <p><u>Building your own D-STAR Decoder</u>
  </p>
  <p>One of the contest rules imposed was that the contesting projects had
    to be fully operational and that all necessary information (in French)
    had to be provided to permit any interested readers to realise their own
    version of the design. Project files and associated documentation for Xavier&#x2019;s
    module can be found <a href="www.on6nr.be">here</a>. The design files contain
    all information for building the Printed Circuit Board, the mbed source
    code and the necessary PC software to activate the D-STAR communication.
    Issue #20, April 2012 of QSP Revue features an article by Xavier providing
    an explanation about DSTAR protocol, theory of operation, implementation
    and circuit production. The mbed/D-STAR module roughly 100 Euros.

    <br>As shown in the videos, Xavier&#x2019;s project is fully operational.
    All aspects of the mbed/Ham contest were upheld: A clearly described project,
    suitable for many potential users, an exceptionally well documented realization
    with all necessary resources and a proven fully functional system. Congratulations
    Xavier!

<u>Objective Completed</u>

    <br>Last year the contest achieved great innovation of the ARM mbed module
    from the French speaking ham radio community. Several articles were published
    in <a href="http://www.on6nr.be/archives.html" rel="nofollow">QSP Revue</a> describing
    the various projects. Thanks to the sponsorship from ARM and Plantronics,
    the participants have been rewarded for their implementations. The initiative
    will be going on again this year and will allow global contributions.</p>
  <p>Detailed information about the mbed QSP Revue Contest 2012 is published
    in the <a href="http://www.on6nr.be/QSPrevue/2012/QSPrevue022012.pdf" rel="nofollow">February issue</a>.
    For inspiration, you can read all about last year&#x2019;s entries, in
    past editions of <a href="http://www.on6nr.be/archives.html" rel="nofollow">QSP Revue</a> and
    mirroring publications.

<p>Thanks Luc, sounds like last years competition generated some really interesting
  projects. We encourage all mbed developers to get involved in the competition
  and look forward to seeing what contestants come up with!</p>
