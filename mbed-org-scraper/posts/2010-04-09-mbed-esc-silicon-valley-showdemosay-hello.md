<p>The Embedded Systems Conference is running April 26-29th in Silicon Valley,
  and we&apos;ll be there! Hopefully with a nice demo...</p>
 <h2>Show</h2> 
<p>The main Embedded Systems Conference expo days are 27th-29th, so one or
  more of us will be around all week. ESC is one of the biggest embedded
  shows, so if you haven&apos;t been before it is well worth a visit.</p>
<p>For more details, see:</p>

</p>
<p>The EDN Innovation Awards are the day before too, so we&apos;ll be there
  to see if we get a mention :)</p>
 <h2>Demo</h2> 
<p>We&apos;re hoping to find time to put together a new demo for the show,
  and it&apos;ll almost certainly be based around one of these:</p>
<p><a href="http://drawn.ca/2006/07/06/ridiculously-intricate-etch-a-sketch-art/"><img alt="" src="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/simon/etchasketch.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>We&apos;re thinking of combining the power of etch-a-sketch with the power
  of LOGO, as a little homage to <a href="http://www.papert.org/">Seymour Papert</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&apos;t read it, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas</a> is
  an interesting read, especially when you consider when it was written and
  the ideas it was presenting; very insightful and influential. LEGO Mindstorms
  was named after it btw!</p>
 <h2>Say Hello!</h2> 
<p>The demo should be up on the NXP stand, so come and find us! If you haven&apos;t
  used mbed yet, we&apos;d be very happy to answer questions and have a chat
  to how it could help you create your next project.&#xA0;For any mbed users
  in the area, make sure you say hi. It&apos;d be great to hear what you
  are up to.</p>
<p>And if anyone is eager enough to want to help out, whether answering questions
  or handing out flyers etc, please give us a shout. Help is always welcome!</p>
<p>We&apos;re also considering running a workshop one evening; i&apos;ll
  post more details if we can put some in place, but again I&apos;d be very
  grateful to hear from some helpers. I&apos;m sure it will be part workshop,
  part social, but more to come soon...</p>
