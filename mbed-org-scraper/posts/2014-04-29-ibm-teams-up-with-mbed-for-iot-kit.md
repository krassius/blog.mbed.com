<p>Today at <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/"
  rel="nofollow">IBM impact</a>, we will be previewing the first prototypes
  of the IoT starter kit we have been working on with IBM. Due to be released
  later this year, the kit includes an mbed enabled cellular platform and
  access to IBM IoT cloud, plus all necessary parts needed to run the first
  example programs right out of the box.</p>

<p>IBM are a leading global provider of technology and services. The chances
  are you&apos;ve recently used a service (ATM, supermarket checkout for
  example) that is built on IBM technology. With a leading position in Big
  Data (moving, storing and analysis) it was a natural fit for us to work
  together, leveraging ARMs leading position Little Data (Sensors, aggregation,
  communication). Bringing these components together realises IBMs long held
  vision of &quot;Instrumented, Interconnected, Intelligent&quot;</p>
<p>Our work with IBM has also included partnering with other leading suppliers
  of cellular hardware (<a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/u-blox-C027/">u-blox</a>)
  and data services, to ensure that we have all we need in the kit to take
  data from sensor to server.</p>
<p>A <a href="/teams/MQTT">MQTT team</a> has also been sprung up and they&apos;re
  porting the official MQTT C library to mbed from <a href="http://eclipse.org/paho/"
  rel="nofollow">Eclipse Paho.</a> This is still a work in progress but HelloMQTT
  and other examples should be ready by the time kits are available. Development
  is happening now so anyone interested in getting started with it, contributing
  or providing feedback can drop a line in <a href="https://mbed.org/teams/mqtt/community/">the teams development forum.</a>

  done some great work bringing this to mbed. You can check out <a href="http://modelbasedtesting.co.uk/?p=94"

</p>
<p>We&apos;ll be posting more as the kit becomes available for pre-order
  with our distributors, so keep an eye out, or if you&apos;re especially
