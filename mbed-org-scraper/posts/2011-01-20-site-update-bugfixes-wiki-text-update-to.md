<p>
  Today we have finally released the version of the site which has
  been in public beta for some time now. This is a relatively minor
  update - the main user visible changes are bugfixes and a move
  away from the TinyMCE editor to our integrated wiki engine.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a few details, for those of you who haven't tried out the
  beta yet.
</p>
<p>
  On the compiler:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speed improvements: load time, scrolling performance
  </li>
  <li>Search and replace feature added, with regular expression
  support
  </li>
  <li>Several bugfixes
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  On the website:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>TinyMCE removed in favour of our <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/cookbook/Wiki-Syntax">wiki engine</a>. Many of
  you are already making <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/cookbook/nRF24L01-wireless-transceiver">good</a>
  <a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/mbed_Client_for_MQTT">use</a>
  of the wiki engine in the Cookbook, and this has now been
  extended to the forum and the notebooks.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Assorted bugfixes
  </li>
</ul>
