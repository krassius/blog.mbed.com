<p>More mbed support is added to the Freedom microcontroller platform line!
  This time it&apos;s the <a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-KL05Z/">FRDM-KL05Z</a>.
  This is ultra-low-cost development platform is enabled by the Kinetis L
  Series KL0x MCU family built on the ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#x2122;-M0+ processor.
  This new platform provides easier migration for 8-bit developers moving
  into the Kinetis portfolio.</p>

<p>Features of the FRDM-KL05Z include easy access to MCU I/O, battery-ready,
  low-power operation, a standard-based form factor with expansion board
  options and a built-in debug interface for flash programming and run-control.
  This platform allows development of devices start from 8 KB of flash in
  a small-footprint 4 x 4 mm 24 QFN package extending up to 32 KB in a 48
  LQFP package.</p>
<p>Last month the <a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-KL46Z/">FRDM-KL46Z</a> became
  another Freedom platform enabled in the mbed ecosystem. It&apos;s also
  based on the ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, but is from the Kinetis KL4x MCU
  family. The Kinetis KL4x family is compatible with the Kinetis K40 based
  on ARM Cortex-M4 processor which creates a bridge to higher performance
  and feature integration. This platform is well suited to develop devices
  with display-based applications like electronic scales, thermostats, flow
  meters and smart meters.</p>
