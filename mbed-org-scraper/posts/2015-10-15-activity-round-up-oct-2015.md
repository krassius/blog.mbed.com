<p>
  It has been a while since we last did a round up. Needless to say
  we, have been a little busy and here are some of the recent
  highlights and activities.
</p>
<h2>
  mbed Enabled program applications open!
</h2>
<p>
  Earlier in the summer we announced the mbed Enabled™ program.
  Well it's here and applications are now open!
</p>

<p>
  The mbed Enabled program is designed for mbed developers and
  partners who want to clearly identify their products as
  interoperable mbed Enabled technologies. This program allows mbed
  developers to focus their efforts on products that are compatible
  with the mbed development environment and interoperable with each
  other, and so reduce their time to market. It also gives further
  credibility to cloud services, silicon and OEM products in the
  Internet of Things (IoT) market by identifying them as
  standards-based.

<h2>
  How to apply?
</h2>
<p>
  We have divided the program and applications into two phases.

  Learning to code with Cannybots
</h2>
<p>
  Cannybots is a 3D printed toy robot car that aims to make
  learning to program fun and interactive. The car was developed
  with a mbed Enabled Nordic NRF15822 BLE board and a bespoke
  utility for drag and drop over the air programing. Check out this
  <a href=
  "http://forum.cannybots.com/t/drag-and-drop-over-the-air-programming-mbed-without-wires/68"
  rel="nofollow">video</a> of the sequence in action. Their
  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397692060/toys-20-interactive-programmable-smart-cannybots"
  rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> launch on September 29, 2015 and
  funded in one day!

  If you are planning to attend ARM TechCon or will be in Santa
  Clara, CA from Novemeber 10-12, stop by the <a href=
  "http://www.armtechcon.com/mbed-zone-2/" rel="nofollow">ARM mbed
  Zone</a>. Meet the lead engineers who are designing the mbed OS
  to find out how it accelerates your development. ARM’s cloud
  services teams will be at the technology bar showing how easy it
  is to connect edge devices to the cloud whether it’s for
  development or mass production. ARM will also be joined by over
  20 partners from the mbed ecosystem who have deployed mbed
  Enabled products and services today.
