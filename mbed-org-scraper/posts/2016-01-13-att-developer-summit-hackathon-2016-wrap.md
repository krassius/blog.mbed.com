<p>This year at the AT&amp;T Developer Summit Hackathon in Las Vegas just
  after the new year began, hackers, coders, and engineers gathered to build
  innovative solutions that aimed to tackle some of the challenges of smart
  homes, smart cities and connected health.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm at the event from the participants to gain and share knowledge
  was inspiring. We held a bootstrap session to teach developers how to get
  started using AT&amp;T M2X IoT backend with mbed to be able to connect
  devices to the cloud. Check out our video to find out how for yourself.</p>

  <p>After a long sleepless 48 hours, 20 teams were selected as finalists to
    present their projects on stage. With over $300K in prizes available at
    the event, the anticipation was high. We offered our own Sponsor Kicker
    Prize of $5K for the best use of ARM mbed. The Best use of ARM mbed IoT
    Device Platform</p>
  <p>Memory Lane was selected as the winner of our kicker prize. MemoryLane
    created an application that improves the quality of life for those affected
    by Alzheimer and their caregivers. This was shown through the use of a
    connect pill bottle that utilized and NXP FRDM-K64F board to track when
    and how much medication a patient takes, with the ability to remotely notify
    the caregiver.</p>

  <p>Big thanks to our partners NXP and ST Microelectronics who attended the
    event as well and provided the developers with hardware and connectivity
    shields.</p>
