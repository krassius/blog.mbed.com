  While we were sleeping in the UK, <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/users/simon/">Simon</a> was busy in San Jose,
  California, preparing for the <a href=
  "http://esc-sv09.techinsightsevents.com/">Embedded System
  Conference</a>, which&nbsp;starts today.
</p>
<p>
  Ahead of the show, Simon attended the 20th Annual <a href=
  "http://www.edn.com">EDN</a> <a href=
  "http://www.edn.com/article/CA6727246.html">Innovation Awards</a>
  ceremony.
</p>
<p>
  We are very pleased to be able to announce that mbed has won in
  the Software/Embedded&nbsp;Tools category!

<p>
  Winning this award is a great acknowledgement of the many hours
  of hard work put in&nbsp;(and doubtless many hours to come!) by
  the entire mbed team and user community.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks!
