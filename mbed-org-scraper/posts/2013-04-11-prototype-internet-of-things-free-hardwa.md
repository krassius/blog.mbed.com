<p>Following our announcement that mbed.org now supports the Freescale FRDM
  KL25Z, I got a call from Jim Carver at Avnet, who was keen to tell me about
  their new <a href="http://www.em.avnet.com//en-us/design/drc/Pages/Avnet-Wi-Go-Module.aspx"
  rel="nofollow">Wi-Go</a> module for the the FRDM KL25Z, which has been designed
  for prototyping &quot;Internet of Things&quot; applications.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The module has a sensor for just about everything you might want to sense
  :</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 Axis accelerometer for 3D acceleration (MMA8451Q)</li>
  <li>Magnetometer for compass direction (MAG3110)</li>
  <li>Altimeter based elevation (MPL3115A2)</li>
  <li>Air Pressure (MPL3115A2)</li>
  <li>Temperature (MPL3115A2)</li>
  <li>Ambient Light Level (TEMT6200)</li>
  <li>Serial flash memory (S25FL216K)</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi Communications module (LBWA1ZZVK7)</li>
</ul>
<p>It also includes an 800mAH LiPo battery, which is capable of powering
  the module for a substantial length of time, and can also be recharged
  from USB connector. This makes it great for prototyping untethered nodes
  for IoT Applications.</p>
<p>Jim has allocated 5 of these Wi-Go modules for mbed users who want to
  prototype something IoT. We&apos;ll send then free of charge, to the successful
  applicants, and in mbed tradition all we ask in return is a cookbook page
  with a published, documented library, and a hello world program.</p>
<p>There are 8 sensors which need cookbook page + library, and 5 boards to
  give away, so applicants must be willing to write more than one!</p>
<p>If you would like to apply, please email <a href="mailto:support@mbed.org?subject=Avnet-Wi-Go">support@mbed.org</a> with
  your mbed user name, and which of the components listed below you&apos;d
  like to develop for.</p>
<p>Of course, if you just want to buy one straight away and get started on
  your own IoT projects, they are also available to sale here :</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.em.avnet.com//en-us/design/drc/Pages/Avnet-Wi-Go-Module.aspx"

</ul>
<p><strong>There&apos;s even prizes! ...</strong>
</p>
<p>Programs exported from the mbed online compiler in MDK format are eligible
  to enter the <a href="http://www.em.avnet.com/en-us/design/trainingandevents/Pages/Avnet-Wi-Go-Design-Challenge.aspx"
