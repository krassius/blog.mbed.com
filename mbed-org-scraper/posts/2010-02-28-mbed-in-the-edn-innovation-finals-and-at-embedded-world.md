<p>An unexpected email this week told me mbed has been chosen for the finals
  of the EDN Innovation awards. That&apos;s pretty cool!</p>

</p>
<p>If you think we&apos;d be a worthy winner for their tools category, it&apos;d
  be great if you could support us and go and <a href="http://www.edn.com/info/CA6718356.html?industryid=49169"><strong>vote for mbed to win!</strong></a> It&apos;d
  be an honour to win something like this, and certainly we never dreamed
  of being considered in these sorts of thing when we launched 4 months ago!</p>
<p>Next up, embedded world...</p>

<p>We&apos;re going to be out at embedded world next week in Nuremberg. We&apos;ll
  be around the show floor, and NXP should have a demo setup on their stand
  to play with so I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll hang about that too. So if you
  are visiting, come and say hi!</p>
<p>We also noticed the last day at Nuremberg is <a href="http://www.embedded-world.de/en/student_day/">Student Day</a>,
  so if you are a student visiting who is using mbed in a project, or you
  are planning to, come and have a chat about your ideas. We&apos;re thinking
  of sponsoring a few student projects with mbed&apos;s too, so come and
  make your case :)</p>
