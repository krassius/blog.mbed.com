<p>
  The mbed Compiler just got some updates!&nbsp;There were a
  collection of fixes to squish some corner case bugs, but also a
  brand new feature...
</p>
<p>
  You can now expand any libraries in your projects, and the
  compiler will render the api documentation within them. A picture
  says a thousand words, so here you go:
</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" height="480" src=
  "https://developer.mbed.org/projects/cookbook/svn/img/api-viewer.png"
  width="640">
</p>
<p>
  This works not only for the core mbed libraries, but also any
  other libraries people post if they are marked up with the
  "natural docs" auto-documentation markup.
</p>
<p>
  Hope you like it!
</p>
