  This is a first sketch of an idea for a really small
  experiment/workshop board. The basic aim is to pack a board full
  of interesting components that use the different interfaces of
  the mbed, and that can be used for experiments in labs and
  workshops.

  his design for a <a href="http://alexlouden.com/2011/bcbreakout/"
  rel="nofollow">breakout board the size of a business card</a> a
  while back, so when we decided to look at a self-contained
  experimenter board, it seemed a shame not to try and continue the
  trend!

  Easy to draw on a board, but now Ioannis is working out if we
  really can cram that 0.5m drawing down to a PCB the size of a
  business card! We'll tell you how it goes...
