<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Our hosting network is going to be upgraded this weekend, which is designed
  to improve resiliency as well as allow for future growth. Unfortunately,
  some disruption to the website is unavoidable. This will be kept to a minimum
  as far as possible, but do expect some periods of downtime over the weekend.</p>
<p>While that&apos;s going on, I&apos;ll take the opportunity to do some
  software/hardware updates, including a major update to the compiler. After
  the upgrades are done, Simon will post full details of the compiler upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>
