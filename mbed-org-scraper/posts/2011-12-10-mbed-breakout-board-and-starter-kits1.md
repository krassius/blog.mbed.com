<p>Take a look at these awesome new mbed-related products that were posted
  in our announcements forum by Cool Components and SK Pang...</p>
<p>First up, a breakout board from <a href="http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/">Cool Components</a> that
  makes all the key interfaces easy to plug in to:</p>

</p>
<p>So that is Ethernet, USB and Micro SD card sorted, plus a spare row of
  sockets either side of the mbed for wires.</p>
<p>And from <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/">SK Pang Electronics</a>, a
  couple of great starter kits to get going with mbed. Here is the bigger
  one:</p>

<p>Great work!</p>
