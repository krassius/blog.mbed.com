  William Jessup Salisbury from <a href=
  "http://sites.tufts.edu/hybridracing/" rel="nofollow">Tufts
  Hybrid Racing Team</a> has written a blog about using mbed
  <a href="/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC1768">NXP LPC1768
  Microcontroller</a> as a critical part of the management system
  of their hybrid racecar - THR12.<br>

  The team are taking part in the <a href=
  "http://formula-hybrid.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">Formula
  Hybrid</a> International Challenge where college and university
  students to design, build, and compete high-performance hybrid
  and electric vehicles. He writes about how the THR12 features
  four independent mbeds: a Control Node, a Human-Computer
  Interaction Node and two Sensor Nodes all communicating over a
  CAN Bus.

  Great to see mbed being used for such a crucial part of their
  racecar. We wish them the very best for the race!
