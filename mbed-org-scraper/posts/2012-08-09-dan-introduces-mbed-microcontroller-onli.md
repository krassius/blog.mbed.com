  Dan introduces some of the new collaboration features we've been
  adding to enable you to collaborate on microcontroller programs
  and libraries across the world!
</p>

</div>
<p>
  The system integrates full distributed version control (DVCS)
  based on mercurial within the online IDE, so you can fork, edit,
  publish and collaborate all online in a few clicks!
</p>
<p>
  Were also working on better discovery of code and showing what
  libraries are popular, to help you find what you want and to help
  you see how what you publish gets used! More on that soon...
</p>
<p>
  All these tools come free when you buy an mbed Microcontroller,
  so encourage your colleagues across the world to get hold of some
  in their labs and put these collaboration features to use in your
  team!

<p>
  And remember to update your profile to add yourself to the mbed
  map; you might just find a few people local to you who may want
  to meet up physically as well as virtually!
