  This is very cool! Jim Carver at <a href=
  "http://www.avnet.com/">Avnet</a> has taken his mbed and made a
  video showing it off. It is a really nice intro to mbed itself,
  but the coolest part is what he is doing with it...
</p>
<p>
  As he calls it, "the mbed challenge"; take an old 8051 MCU based
  board and try and bypass the chip to wire in the mbed instead.
  And then import the 8051 C code and try an port it across to ARM.
  Watch the video to see the results:

  My favourite parts are the bits where he is looking at what he
  needs to change and comparing the architectures, showing how nice
  it is to code with a modern MCU!
</p>
<p>
  And great to see mbed letting him experiment so easily; just what
  it was designed for - great work Jim!
