<p>Over the last few weeks I have been responding to <a href="http://mbed.org/users/robodude/">Robbie King&apos;s</a> questions
  about reference design issues (See <a href="http://mbed.org/users/chris/notebook/Patching-functions-and-libraries">Patching functions and libraries</a> and
  <a
  href="http://mbed.org/forum/bugs-suggestions/topic/4008/">USB line termination in mbed LPC11U24</a>). Robbie is turning his mbed
    NXP LPC11U24 design into a PCB level design, and so wanted to make sure
    he was building the right thing. It occurred to me that there are probably
    lots of other mbed users making custom PCBs to take their prototypes to
    the next level, but we don&apos;t often hear about it.</p>
<p>For custom PCB prototypes I have been using <a href="www.seeedstudio.com">Seeedstudio</a> 
  <a
  href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-p-835.html?cPath=185"
  rel="nofollow">Fusion PCB Service</a>. The one shown here is an LPC11U24 breakout for
    testing the mass storage boot loader. At 5cm x 5cm, it only cost $9.90
    for 10-off, and as I wasn&apos;t in a hurry (I have plenty other things
    to do here at mbed HQ!) the $3 delivery option was fine. The whole thing
    was $14 delivered.</p>

<p>Seeedstudio recently introduced a gift certificate feature on their site,
  and have offered some gift certificates for sponsoring some PCBs.</p>
<p>If you&apos;d like to showcase what you&apos;ve been working on, and maybe
  win a gift certificate, drop us a line at support@mbed.org, and tell us
  a little about the design you&apos;re working on, why it is cool, and why
  you should get your PCBs for free! I&apos;ll keep entries open until 18th
  October (you have a week!), after which we&apos;ll award the certificates.
  Once the PCBs are made, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to write a guest
  blog article showcasing your design!</p>
