<p>
  We've just added a page which plots a map of anyone who's put a
  location in their mbed public profile!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://mbed.org/map/">The mbed world map</a>
</p>
<p>
  What might be interesting is having a look to see if you can spot
  any mbed users near you you might not know about.
</p>
<p>
  Not on the map? Just complete your mbed profile and you should
  appear on the mbed map within a day.
