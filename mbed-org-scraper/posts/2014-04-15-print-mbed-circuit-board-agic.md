<p>One of the key phases in product development is building your breadboard,
  however it can be a bit of a wiry mess and replicating it more than once
  can be one of the many frustrations of prototyping. Wouldn&#x2019;t it
  be nice if you could just print them on your home printer and each one
  is identical with no wires to worry about? Well <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1597902824/agic-print-printing-circuit-boards-with-home-print"
  rel="nofollow">AgIC Inc.</a> has set out to do just that. As a recent Kickstarter
  that successfully met its funding and exceeded it by 2.6x its goal, you
  could soon print your circuit boards from an ink jet printer with their
  &#x2018;magical conductive ink.&#x2019;</p>

<p>The AgIC Printer not only makes circuit patter design simpler, but after
  you have tested your prototype circuit and determined it works as you want,
  you can send out the same layout file to a PCB fabrication service. This
  saves you time and money re-ordering PCBs. One of the coolest part of this
  great invention is that it is while you could make any circuit you want,
  you can make one for your favorite mbed board! You can see an example of
  this in the video below where they are using an NXP LPC1114FN28 board.</p>
<p>We got a chance to catch up with the founder and CEO of AgIC Inc., Shinya
  Shimizu, last week. Shimizu-san says the next development he is working
  on is enabling the printers to safely print double layers for more complex
  circuit layouts. AgIC Inc. has created a great invention and we look forward
  to testing it out for ourselves in the future!</p>
