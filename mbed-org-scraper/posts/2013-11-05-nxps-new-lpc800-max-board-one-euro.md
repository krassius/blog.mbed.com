<div class="flashbox finfo">
  <h4 class="ftitle">Information</h4>
  <p>NXP have informed me that due to overwhelming response, all the vouchers
    have now been redeemed.</p>
  <p>The board is now available for purchase directly from <a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/products/lpcxpresso/lpc812_max.php"
    rel="nofollow">Embedded Artists</a> or from your local NXP authorized distributor.
    If you did receive a voucher but have not used it yet, note that it is
    only valid until 30th of October 2013!</p>
</div>
<p>NXP have announced the availability of the mbed enabled NXP LPC800-MAX
  board, along with a promotion to make the hardware available for just 1
  Euro.</p>
<p>The LPC800-MAX is based on NXPs LPC812, a Cortex-M0+ that is aimed at
  8/16 applications where additional functionality and performance is required.
  The board is primarily an Arduino compatible form factor, but as the LPC812
  has a full crossbar for IO routing it can also support the standard pinouts
  for LPCXpresso and the mbed DIP form factor.</p>

<p>To enable as many projects as possible, the LPC800-MAX board includes
  additional analog (A/D and D/A) and digital GPIO provided by I2C devices.
  These parts are likely to find their way into many designs based on the
  LPC800-MAX reference design, and so we want to encourage a good quality
  <a
  href="http://mbed.org/components/">Component Database</a>entry for each.</p>
<p>The Component Database is a feature we introduced recently to host reusable
  libraries for different hardware, middleware and IoT services that you
  can use with ARM Microcontrollers. These components can be used as building
  blocks for quickly developing prototypes and products.</p>
<p>Components and the associated libraries, examples and documentation are
  created and added to the database by mbed developers, component manufacturers
  and service providers. The goal is to create a canonical database of rock-solid
  code and resources for every useful component that can be used with ARM
  microcontrollers.</p>
<p>As an incentive to get these I2C parts into the Component Database, NXP
  have provided a few boards that we can give away in exchange for making
  the entry. If you would like to make the entry for one of these parts,
  please email support@mbed.org providing :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>mbed User name</li>
  <li>Full postal address</li>
  <li>Contact phone number (needed by Fed Ex)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&apos;re looking forward to seeing what the mbed community does with
  the LPC800-MAX - feel free to post to the forum to show everyone what you&apos;ve
  been doing!</p>
