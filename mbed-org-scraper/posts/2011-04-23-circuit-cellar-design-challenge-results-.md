  Did you enter the Circuit Cellar design challenge? Well, the
  results are going to be announced soon...

  Late last year, NXP, Circuit Cellar and Elektor set the <a href=
  "http://www.circuitcellar.com/nxpmbeddesignchallenge/" rel=
  "nofollow">mbed NXP Design Challenge</a>. I didn't know what to
  expect, but apparently it turns out it was the biggest response
  they've ever received for a competition (and they've been running
  these for 10 years). Well done everyone!
</p>
<p>
  I'm going to travel over to the Embedded Systems Conference in
  Silicon Valley at the start of May where the winners are going to
  be announced. Hopefully we'll see some of you who entered there.

<p>
  I'd also love to showcase some of these entries on the site.
</p>
<p>
  If you entered the competition, or even if you built a project
  but missed the deadline, I'd love to see some videos of what you
  got up to. I'm thinking just a short YouTube video to capture the
  "what" and a little bit of "how"; in my experience people have
  short attention spans, so keep it between 30sec to 2min.
</p>
<p>
  If you post one, just fire me a link and I'll try and post some
  of them to the site. It should be great inspiration for other
  mbed-ers!
