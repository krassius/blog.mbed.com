<p>Our longtime partner of mbed, <a href="http://www.nxp.com/news/press-releases/2014/04/nxp-lpcxpresso-and-arms-mbed-platform-now-fully-aligned.html"
  rel="nofollow">NXP, is releasing a version 2 of their LPCXpresso development boards range</a>,
  which will all support mbed! This will allow more flexibility and choice
  as you&apos;ll be able to use both the existing LPCXpresso tools and now
  all the mbed tools and libraries!</p>

<p>Here are more details from NXP:</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>This new alignment with the LPCXpresso will allow developers access to
    leverage both <a href="http://mbed.org/">mbed.org</a> and <a href="http://lpcware.com/"
    rel="nofollow">LPCWare.com</a> communities for support, code and other resources.
    In addition they will have more choice for MCU selection, and prototyping
    features. They will also be able to easily export projects from mbed to
    LPCXpresso environments.</p>
  <p>The LPCXpresso platform includes the v7.1 LPCXpresso IDE, allowing for
    more efficient evaluation and development of advanced application for NXP
    LPC microcontrollers. This toolchain includes multiple improvements in
    compiler optimization, IDE speed and feature set, access to ARM&#x2019;s
    latest new lib-nano C library and support of Segger&#x2019;s popular debug
    probe and related utilities.</p>
