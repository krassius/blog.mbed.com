<p>Just to let you know, the compiler has just undergone some updates...&#xA0;</p>
<p>Most notably, this should fix a bug we&apos;ve seen a few of you report&#xA0;around
  reliability of the compile/download button. This was causing&#xA0;the compiler
  to intermittently hang, which is really bad news! This&#xA0;should now
  have been squished!&#xA0;If you do find any reliability problems, especially
  compiler hangs or&#xA0;failed download, please make sure you tell us! This
  is not acceptable&#xA0;behaviour so we want to know if it happens. Thank
  you to those who&#xA0;reported the previous bug, and hopefully you will
  no longer see these&#xA0;problems.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Also in this update:&#xA0;</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Find&quot; within a file (click the find button, or hit ctrl-F)&#xA0;</li>
  <li>&quot;Clone&quot; projects and &quot;Save As..&quot; files (i.e. replicate
    them)&#xA0;</li>
  <li>Increased file import size limit (was causing things to fail to&#xA0;import)</li>
  <li>A few other fixes to make things run more smoothly&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Hope you enjoy it :) Any feedback welcome...&#xA0;</p>
<p>Have fun!&#xA0;
