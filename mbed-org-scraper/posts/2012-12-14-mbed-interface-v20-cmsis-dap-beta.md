<p>We are pleased to announce the beta version of the mbed Interface v2.0
  firmware!</p>

</p>
<p>This beta firmware adds support for the new <a href="http://mbed.org/handbook/CMSIS-DAP">CMSIS-DAP</a> USB
  debug connection. In addition to the drag n drop flash programming and
  the virtual serial port interface, you can use a CMSIS-DAP compliant offline
  toolchain to connect to your mbed to be able to develop and debug your
  programs!</p>
<p>Here are some more details...</p>
<p>A few months ago we mentioned we were <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/mbed-Interface-v20-experiments-Adding-CM/">doing some experiments with adding CMSIS-DAP to mbed hardware</a>,
  and based on the great feedback we decided to develop it further and it
  is now available as a beta trial.</p>
<p><a href="/handbook/CMSIS-DAP">CMSIS-DAP</a> is a open USB interface standard
  for connecting to the coresight debug infrastructure on Cortex-M microcontrollers,
  making it much easier to build low-cost boards that have on-board USB debug
  interfaces.</p>
<p>The primary goal for this trial is to get more people testing; different
  use cases, different projects, and really prove the CMSIS-DAP implementation
  we have for the mbed Microcontroller.</p>
<p>To use it, you just need to update the firmware on your mbed (don&apos;t
  worry, it is easily upgraded and reverted) and connect with a CMSIS-DAP
  compliant toolchain. We&apos;ve been using MDK as one of our test toolchains,
  and it has CMSIS-DAP support in it publicly from MDK uVision 4.60. To find
  out more about enabling your mbed microcontroller with CMSIS-DAP, installing
  Keil MDK and debugging your first applications, please see the following

<p>If you have any queries, questions or feedback, please contact <a href="support%40mbed.org">support@mbed.org</a> or
  discuss in the forums.</p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>

<p>We also plan to release in the near future a CMSIS-DAP python library
  which will allow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>debugging using GDB, as a gdbserver will be integrated on the library</li>
  <li>writing python applications that can communicate with the CMSIS-DAP and
    coresight debug interface:
    <ul>
      <li>read/write memory</li>
      <li>read/write core registers</li>
      <li>set breakpoints</li>
      <li>flash new binary</li>
      <li>run/stop/step the execution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>act as a great reference to show how the CMSIS-DAP protocol works</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also supporting others adding it to their tools, and expect to
  see CMSIS-DAP support in OpenOCD soon!</p>
<p>Looking forward to the feedback!</p>
