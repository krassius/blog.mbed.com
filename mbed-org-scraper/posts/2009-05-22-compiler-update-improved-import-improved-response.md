<p>We have just put some new compiler enhancements live. Hope you like&#xA0;them....</p>
<p>The compiler importing functionality has been respun. Apart from being&#xA0;much
  more stable, you can now import programs and files from both your&#xA0;desktop
  and from subversion repository, making it easy to pull in&#xA0;other peoples
  published examples. As before, libraries can also be&#xA0;pulled in from
  subversion, making it easy to share more stable code&#xA0;bundles as libraries.</p>
<p>The compiler framework and infrastructure have also been enhanced&#xA0;under
  the hood; you should see the interface giving you a lot more&#xA0;feedback
  while compiling, and a bottleneck has been removed so it&#xA0;should be
  consistently more responsive too.&#xA0;We&apos;ve folded in some other
  fixes too, so we&apos;re hoping this is all good&#xA0;news! But if you
  do see any bad behaviour or bugs, please make sure&#xA0;you email us at
  support@mbed.co.uk.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it&apos;d also be good to hear reports of things that&#xA0;work
  better :) The bugs are most important to catch, but knowing&#xA0;things
  that have worked out will help check we&apos;re moving in the right&#xA0;direction!</p>
<p>Thanks,&#xA0;
  <br>Simon</p>
