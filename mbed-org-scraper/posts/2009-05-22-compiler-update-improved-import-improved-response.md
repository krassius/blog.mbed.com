<p>
  We have just put some new compiler enhancements live. Hope you
  like&nbsp;them....
</p>
<p>
  The compiler importing functionality has been respun. Apart from
  being&nbsp;much more stable, you can now import programs and
  files from both your&nbsp;desktop and from subversion repository,
  making it easy to pull in&nbsp;other peoples published examples.
  As before, libraries can also be&nbsp;pulled in from subversion,
  making it easy to share more stable code&nbsp;bundles as
  libraries.
</p>
<p>
  The compiler framework and infrastructure have also been
  enhanced&nbsp;under the hood; you should see the interface giving
  you a lot more&nbsp;feedback while compiling, and a bottleneck
  has been removed so it&nbsp;should be consistently more
  responsive too.&nbsp;We've folded in some other fixes too, so
  we're hoping this is all good&nbsp;news! But if you do see any
  bad behaviour or bugs, please make sure&nbsp;you email us at
  support@mbed.co.uk.
</p>
<p>
  Thinking about it, it'd also be good to hear reports of things
  that&nbsp;work better :) The bugs are most important to catch,
  but knowing&nbsp;things that have worked out will help check
  we're moving in the right&nbsp;direction!
</p>
<p>
  Thanks,&nbsp;<br>
