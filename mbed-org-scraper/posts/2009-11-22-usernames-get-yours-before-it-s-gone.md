<p>
  To support new features, mbed has introduced the concept of
  usernames. These work exactly as you'd expect. All
  <strong>new</strong> signups are now required to choose a
  username as part of the signup process, and that username
  can&nbsp;(normally)&nbsp;never be changed.
</p>
<p>
  However, mbed beta tester veterans who registered prior to the
  recent site upgrade were all assigned usernames in the style
  "user123456789". Anyone with a username in this format can now
  change it to a "proper" username.
</p>
<p>
  To grab your username, just head over to <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/account/settings/">your account</a> and choose
  "Change username".
</p>
<p>
  Note that choosing a new username is completely optional, and
  will not cause any problems if you don't.
