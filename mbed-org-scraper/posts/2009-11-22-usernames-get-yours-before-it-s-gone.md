<p>To support new features, mbed has introduced the concept of usernames.
  These work exactly as you&apos;d expect. All <strong>new </strong>signups
  are now required to choose a username as part of the signup process, and
  that username can&#xA0;(normally)&#xA0;never be changed.</p>
<p>However, mbed beta tester veterans who registered prior to the recent
  site upgrade were all assigned usernames in the style &quot;user123456789&quot;.
  Anyone with a username in this format can now change it to a &quot;proper&quot;
  username.</p>
<p>To grab your username, just head over to <a href="http://mbed.org/account/settings/">your account</a> and
  choose &quot;Change username&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that choosing a new username is completely optional, and will not
  cause any problems if you don&apos;t.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
