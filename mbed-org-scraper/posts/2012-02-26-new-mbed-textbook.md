  Rob Toulson and Tim Wilmshurst, two experts in the field and both
  university lecturers, have just submitted the final copy of their
  new textbook to be published!

  It is based around the mbed and designed to be used as the basis
  for lecture courses, workshops or self-learning.
</p>
<p>
  We got to reviewed the book whilst it was being developed, and
  the quality looks really good. The best thing about it from my
  perspective is that Rob has already run courses based on mbed for
  two years running. Much of this content has been tried and tested
  and is the result of refinement over these two years. Having
  teamed up with Tim who has written a number of very well regarded
  books already, I think the results are going to be brilliant.
</p>
<p>
  They've also been publishing free course slides that go alongside
  the book, so hopefully can be a great inspiration for lectures or
  workshops.
