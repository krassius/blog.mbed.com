  Hi mbed-ers,
</p>
<p>
  Last week I released a set of updates to the mbed website. Many
  of these are a direct response to suggestions/requests made in
  the forums. There is now a dedicated forum for
  requests/suggestions/bug reports - <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/forum/bugs-suggestions/">Bugs &amp;
  Suggestions</a> - please keep them coming!
</p>
<p>
  There is also a <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/projects/tickets/report/6">public bug/wish
  list</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a quick summary of what changed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple forum support
  </li>
  <li>Forum now tracks which posts you have read
  </li>
  <li>You now have the option of auto-subscribing to topics/pages
  you comment on - found in your Account Settings area
  </li>
  <li>Added RSS feeds for just about everything
  </li>
  <li>Activity area now split by type
  </li>
  <li>Improved format of alert emails
  </li>
  <li>Reformatted date display on the site so the dates are useful
  regardless of local timezone
  </li>
  <li>Several other bugfixes and behind the scenes
  improvements/changes.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Please note that this update only covers the website and not the
  online compiler IDE, which will be the subject of a forthcoming
  update.
</p>
<p>
  Cheers,
</p>
<p>
  Dan
