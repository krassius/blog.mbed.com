<p>
  We plan to perform some site maintenance on August the 16th,
  starting from approximately 6pm UK time. That's 10AM New York,
  and 2AM Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
  We expect mbed.org to be unavailable for one hour. After that,
  the site will be available but in a read-only mode, while user
  accounts will be re-enabled one by one over the following hours.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Here's why</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are moving!
</p>
<p>
  mbed is moving to a new datacentre in the US. This will mean:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A faster and more responsive mbed for the majority of our
  users
  </li>
  <li>Much more capacity and room to grow
  </li>
  <li>Better resilience and reliability
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>What's that about user accounts?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  In order to move, we must copy all the user data (your workspace)
  to our new infrastructure. However, it will take several hours to
  copy. To avoid downtime during all of that time, we will bring
  the site back up in a read-only mode in the new location, and
  re-enable users one by one as their data is synchronised to the
  new site.
</p>
<p>
  It will take several hours to complete every single user but if
  you have logged into the site within the past month, your account
  should be re-enabled within an hour or so.
</p>
<p>
  If you try and log in and see a message saying that your account
  is unavailable, please try again in a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for your understanding during this essential work, and
  apologies for the relatively short notice.
</p>
<p>
