<p>I made a video with Donatien yesterday to demonstrate some of the new
  work he has been doing on our HTTP stack, and to show how mbed can help
  prototype the &quot;Internet of Things&quot;. Here is what we came up with...</p>
<p>
  <object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/CQm2B6BqU1I" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
  width="425">
    <param name="data" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CQm2B6BqU1I">
    <param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CQm2B6BqU1I">
  </object>
</p>
<p>The full write up can be found in the mbed cookbook:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/RFID-Tweeter">Internet of Things RFID Tweeter</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is just one example. Hopefully you can think up much more
  useful things to prototype with an internet connected microcontroller!</p>
