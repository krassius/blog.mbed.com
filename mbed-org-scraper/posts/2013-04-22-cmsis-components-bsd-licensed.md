<p>We are pleased to announce that the CMSIS software components used by
  the mbed SDK have been released under a permissive BSD open source license!</p>

  <p>After we <a href="/blog/entry/mbed-SDK-is-now-Open-Source/">announced the open sourcing of the mbed SDK</a> a
    couple of months ago, we received many queries about the license of the
    CMSIS components used by the mbed SDK.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php"
    rel="nofollow">CMSIS</a> package from ARM is not a typical &quot;software
    project&quot;, it is the vehicle used by ARM to provide standard software
    interfaces to the Cortex-M processors. For this reason ARM adopted a customized
    license to serve its standardization effort. Unfortunately, not being a
    well-known license, many developers struggled to understand what were the
    implications of mixing the actual CMSIS software components with proprietary
    code, or code released under a different open source license.</p>
  <p>To clear this confusion, ARM has officially released the software components
    of the CMSIS package, used by the mbed SDK, under the well known and understood
    BSD license, while the CMSIS Specification itself remains licensed under
    an ARM proprietary licence.</p>
  <p>In the official <a href="https://silver.arm.com/browse/CMSIS" rel="nofollow">CMSIS package</a>,
    this is the relevant content of the &quot;CMSIS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT.pdf&quot;:</p>
<pre>The package also includes the components contained in the following directories:
(a) ./CMSIS/DSP_Lib - DSP Library sources and examples;
(b) ./CMSIS/Include - Header files;
(c) ./CMSIS/Lib - DSP Library build for various toolchains;
(d) ./CMSIS/RTOS - Header file template for CMSIS-RTOS implementation; and
(e) ./Device - Template files and implementations for Cortex-M class processors.

All of the above components are licensed to you under the terms of the BSD licence, which is incorporated within
or alongside the above components.
</pre>

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>This makes the whole mbed SDK completely open source with a mix of well
    known and understood permissive open source licenses: Apache and BSD.</p>
  <p>Have fun and keep innovating!</p>
