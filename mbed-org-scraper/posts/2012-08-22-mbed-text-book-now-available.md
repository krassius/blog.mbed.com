</p>
<p>The book is a theoretical approach to many of the topics covered in the
  <a
  href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/Course-Notes">Course Notes</a>that Rob has previously published. Now that the book is
    complete Rob will be working on finalising the slides ready for release.
    Any last bits of feedback are welcome.</p>
<p>Amazon will give you a the opportunity to leaf through the pages, but
  below is couple of pages to give you an idea.</p>
