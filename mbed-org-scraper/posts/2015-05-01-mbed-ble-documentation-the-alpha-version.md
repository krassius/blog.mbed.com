<p>Hello. My name is Irit, and I am the new technical author at mbed. By
  way of introduction, I&#x2019;d like to send you to the alpha version of
  our <a href="http://docs.mbed.org/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/">BLE documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The BLE docs cover two use cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Experienced developers who are interested in mbed BLE.</li>
  <li>People from outside the world of technology who are drawn to BLE to solve
    a particular issue and need a detailed introduction.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#x2019;d like to ask for your feedback on these docs and suggestions
  for additional docs related to mbed BLE. Please comment on this blog post
  with ideas and questions.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
