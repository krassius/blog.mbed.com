<p>
  Next week, the Gadget Show Live! in Birmingham, UK will play host
  to all the latest gadgets from across the world. Well, mbed is
  now going to be there too, sharing a little of what goes on
  behind all those shiny covers!
</p>
<p>
  Background: A few weeks ago, we spent the weekend at Newcastle
  Maker Faire. We were there to let people play with our robots for
  fun, but also to help give a bit of education and insight in to
  embedded technology.
</p>
<p>
  It turns out we also bumped in to lots of engineers. Be it
  embedded engineers, mechanical engineers, computer programmers,
  test engineers or scientists, it was a great place meet people
  from all backgrounds in one place, even if it was "off the
  clock". Many hadn't heard of mbed yet, and after we explained
  what it was, most could tell us (usually via a past experience of
  pain!) how it could help them save time in the future. We came
  away entirely exhausted, but having met lots of interesting
  people in a short space of time, and hopefully some of who we
  will now be able to help with their future projects. A great
  success!
</p>
<p>
  This success made us think about what other events could be an
  opportunity to talk to lots of engineers who don't come to
  embedded trade shows, whilst also being able to share knowledge
  about embedded engineering and technology in general (the greater
  good!).
</p>
<p>
  The same day we were discussing this, I found out about the
  Gadget Show Live:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.gadgetshowlive.net/" rel="nofollow">Gadget
    Show Live!</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It seemed like fate, so I signed us up!
</p>
<p>
  We've never done anything like this, so it is going to be
  interesting to see how it works out. The goals for the show are
  to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Meet engineers who wouldn't normally come to embedded
  electronics shows
  </li>
  <li>Give people insights in to how gadgets actually work and are
  designed
  </li>
  <li>Inspire some people to become engineers and invent their own
  future products
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I remember us saying less than a year ago how "in the future"
  we'd aim to have our own "mbed" stand at a show. We didn't
  realise quite how quickly mbed would catch on to be in a position
  to do it so soon! Given the show is about a week away, we've got
  our work cut out. Here are some of the things we hope to have on
  show...
</p>
<p>
  To help give insight, I thought a "mindmap" or brainstorm of
  electronic modules could give insight in to how you can
  pick-and-mix different functionality, and program a central
  controller to orchestrate it. Hexley suggested basing it around
  the cookbook, so the work in progress is exactly that; an "mbed
  Coookbook Mindmap":
</p>

  <li>
    <a href=
    "http://mbed.org/users/simon/notebook/mbed-mindmap-poster">Cookbook
    Mindmap</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  As an aside, it is great to see how busy people have been; some
  great contributions in the cookbook!
</p>
<p>
  We also know many people won't care too much for the engineering
  behind the scenes, so we're planning some demos to provide some
  fun (with a splash of insight).
</p>
<p>
  Although we said never again, and even wondered if he'd blend, by
  popular demand Billy is going to be re-wired, re-vamped and
  refreshed! And the fact a new I2S high-quality audio reference
  design is in the works means a significant upgrade.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For another demo, we thought what is the number one gadget that
  everyone owns and can relate to? Well, that is a phone. And what
  is the one thing everyone needs on a day out looking at gadgets?
  Well, that is snacks. So we're planning to combine these two in
  to a Snack Machine Service (SMS), that you can text to get a
  snack:

    "http://mbed.org/users/simon/notebook/snack-machine-service/">Snack
    Machine Service</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Still very much a work in progress, but hopefully will get
  finished one evening this week.
</p>
<p>
  And for our final demo, we're thinking what we could do with the
  robots we've got that would be fun? Something wii-ly wii-ly fun?
  We're still working on what that could be...
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully this will be a great opportunity to meet a diverse
  range of engineers mbed can help, whilst doing our bit to help
  give insights in to the technology around us.
</p>
<p>
  The main show runs Wednesday 13th to Sunday 17th April, with a
  trade-only day on Tuesday 12th. If you'll be at the show, come
  and find us on stand M21a, near T3 magazine!
