<p>We&apos;ve just seen RS have announced the first in a new &quot;Synergy&quot;
  range of mbed application breakout boards!</p>
<p>One of the applications they have supported is a high-quality audio DAC
  that can connect to the mbed LPC1768&apos;s I2S port:</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I2S Audio DAC Breakout</td>
    <td>Audio and Power Driver Animatronic baseboard</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For the I2S, there is already a library in the cookbook to allow you to
  talk to the TI DAC that is on it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/TLV320AIC23B">Audio Breakout TLV320AIC23B Cookbook page</a>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>This will be excellent for audio recording and playback. Maybe couple
  it with the new <a href="/handbook/USBAudio">USBAudio</a> class for a USB-DAC?!</p>
<p>Take a look at their webpage for more information:</p>
