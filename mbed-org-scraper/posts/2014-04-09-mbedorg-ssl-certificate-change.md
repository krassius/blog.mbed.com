<p>
  At around 23:00 UTC (00:00 BST, 18:00 EDT, 16:00 PDT) on April
  9th we will be updating our SSL certificate. We anticipate any
  service disruption to be minimal and to last less than a minute.
</p>
<p>
  This is a precautionary measure in response to the <a href=
  "http://heartbleed.com" rel="nofollow">heartbleed bug</a> which
  has affected many internet services. We have already taken the
  steps necessary to ensure mbed.org is not affected by this
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  UPDATE: This work has been completed.
