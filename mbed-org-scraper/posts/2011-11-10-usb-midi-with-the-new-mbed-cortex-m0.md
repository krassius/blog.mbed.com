<p>Here is the next addition to our USB library under development, USB MIDI:</p>

  <p>In the example, the buttons send MIDI note on and note off messages to
    the PC, and the LEDs respond to them from the PC. You can also send other
    MIDI messages such as controller messages with this library.</p>
  <p>This could be used to build custom MIDI input instruments and controllers
    to record to a sequencer or trigger a soft-synth, and build MIDI output
    devices such as physical playback instruments or even to drive animatronics
    or other systems that could benefit from being sequenced alongside other
    music or video material.</p>
