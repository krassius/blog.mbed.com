    As brewed in the forums, we're going to run a competition.
    You've got ~2.5 weeks to make something very cool with your
    beta mbed.&nbsp;The best demos will get one of our new mbed
    Microcontrollers, and if they are good enough, (and pending
    logistics), we could even take some with us on demo tours :)
    Here is how it will work:
  </p>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Requirements: It must be awesome, useful, or both :)
      </li>
      <li>End date:&nbsp;<strong>Friday 18th September</strong>
      (posted on the forum, and ideally in the cookbook)
      </li>
      <li>Rules:&nbsp;I make the rules, I can change them. Accept
      it in the spirit it is intended and have fun!
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>
    You haven't got long, so get started now. If you haven't played
    with your mbed for a while, dust it off now; it's why you are
    on the beta in the first place! No excuses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Post any comments, ideas, plans, progress photos, videos to the
    forum thread @&nbsp;<a href="/forum/topic/75/" style=

  </p>
  <p>
    Looking forward to some great projects.&nbsp;Good luck!
