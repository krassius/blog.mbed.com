  <p>As brewed in the forums, we&apos;re going to run a competition. You&apos;ve
    got ~2.5 weeks to make something very cool with your beta mbed.&#xA0;The
    best demos will get one of our new mbed Microcontrollers, and if they are
    good enough, (and pending logistics), we could even take some with us on
    demo tours :) Here is how it will work:</p>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Requirements: It must be awesome, useful, or both :)</li>
      <li>End date:&#xA0;<strong>Friday 18th September</strong> (posted on the forum,
        and ideally in the cookbook)</li>
      <li>Rules:&#xA0;I make the rules, I can change them. Accept it in the spirit
        it is intended and have fun!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>You haven&apos;t got long, so get started now. If you haven&apos;t played
    with your mbed for a while, dust it off now; it&apos;s why you are on the
    beta in the first place! No excuses.</p>
  <p>Post any comments, ideas, plans, progress photos, videos to the forum
    thread @&#xA0;<a href="/forum/topic/75/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0073bd !important;">http://mbed.org/forum/topic/75/</a>
  </p>
  <p>Looking forward to some great projects.&#xA0;Good luck!</p>
