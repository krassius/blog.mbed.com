  Hello Beta testers!
</p>
<p>
  We have some really big news. We didn't want to promise too much
  before it was all set in stone, but we've been working very hard
  to make mbed *real*, and I think we've done it!
</p>
<p>
  We've teamed up with NXP and have been developing a version of
  <a href="/nxp/lpc1768/">mbed based on their new LPC1768 MCU</a>,
  which gives us an upgrade to an ARM Cortex-M3 core, so there is
  even more performance. And best of all, the hardware design is
  now complete and we've got them going in to production as we
  speak!
</p>
<p>
  And NXP have invited us to be on their stand at ESC Boston next
  week, so that means we'll be going live!
</p>
<p>
  NXP are going to be selling these boards through some major
  distributors too, and they'll be available for pre-order next
  week.
</p>
<p>
  We'll have a demo there too, and we'll put up a page about it
  soon, but hopefully it will be interactive :) To give you a hint,
  here is a little logo I just made:

<p>
  More info next week, and on our <a href=
  "http://twitter.com/mbedmicro">http://twitter.com/mbedmicro</a>
  feed.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks again to everyone who has helped mbed get this far.
  Hopefully this is just the beginning!
</p>
<p>
