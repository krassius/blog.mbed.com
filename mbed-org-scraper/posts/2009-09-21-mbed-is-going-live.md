<p>Hello Beta testers!</p>
<p>We have some really big news. We didn&apos;t want to promise too much
  before it was all set in stone, but we&apos;ve been working very hard to
  make mbed *real*, and I think we&apos;ve done it!</p>
<p>We&apos;ve teamed up with NXP and have been developing a version of
  <a
  href="/nxp/lpc1768/">mbed based on their new LPC1768 MCU</a>, which gives us an upgrade to
    an ARM Cortex-M3 core, so there is even more performance. And best of all,
    the hardware design is now complete and we&apos;ve got them going in to
    production as we speak!</p>
<p>And NXP have invited us to be on their stand at ESC Boston next week,
  so that means we&apos;ll be going live!</p>
<p>NXP are going to be selling these boards through some major distributors
  too, and they&apos;ll be available for pre-order next week.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll have a demo there too, and we&apos;ll put up a page about it
  soon, but hopefully it will be interactive :) To give you a hint, here
  is a little logo I just made:</p>

<p>More info next week, and on our <a href="http://twitter.com/mbedmicro">http://twitter.com/mbedmicro</a> feed.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who has helped mbed get this far. Hopefully this
  is just the beginning!</p>
<p>Simon</p>
