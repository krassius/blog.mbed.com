  The mbed Team has been busy the last few weeks getting ready for
  <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en/" rel=
  "nofollow">Embedded World (EW)</a> in Nuremberg, Germany and now
  we are looking forward to <a href=
  "http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" rel="nofollow">Mobile World
  Congress (MWC)</a> in Barcelona, Spain this coming week. There
  has been much to celebrate from the collaboration with IBM to
  announce the IoT Starter Kit – Ethernet Edition to the ARM mbed
  Device Server 2.3 release.
</p>
<p>
  At EW we announced the <a href=
  "http://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/IoT-Starter-Kit-Ethernet-Edition/">
  IoT Starter Kit – Ethernet Edition</a> that was developed jointly
  with <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/teams/IBM_IoT/">IBM</a>.
  This kit is intended to help developers build devices that
  connect to the IBM cloud (IBM BlueMix platform) and further build
  out the ecosystem of IoT. Additionally, at EW we showcased two
  demos; our ARM mbed Bluetooth Low Energy solutions and the Thread
  stack running with mbed OS. Check out the videos below to see the
  demos in action.

  At MWC this coming week, we will be featuring our mbed Device
  Server. One will be showing our Smart City demo which was
  developed with <a href=
  "http://developer.mbed.org/teams/WoTio/">wot.io</a>, <a href=
  "http://developer.mbed.org/teams/MultiTech/">MultiTech</a> and
  <a href="http://www.stream-technologies.com/" rel=
  "nofollow">Stream Technologies</a>. In this demo you will see a
  real life scenario where delivery vehicles are tracked through
  London and augmented with real-time traffic information provided
  by London Open Data and traffic cameras. Not to be missed, we
  will be measuring many live statistics from the ARM booth
  (temperature, average height of attendees, noise levels, etc.) to
  showcase how mbed enabled devices can collect live data from the
  edge of a network and feed it to an ARM powered server running
  the mbed Device Server. Be sure to stop by our stand (Hall 6,
  Stand 6C10) to see both demos in action, if at MWC.
</p>
<p>
  Last by certainly not least, we have released the ARM mbed Device
  Server 2.3. This release adds more key functionality to allow us
  to better serve the needs of mbed Device Server users. To find
  out more, see Neil Jackson’s blog post <a href=
