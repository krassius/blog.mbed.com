  This last weekend the Austin team spent the weekend at <a href=
  "http://sxsw.com/exhibitions/sx-create" rel="nofollow">SXSW
  Create</a>. Create is a part of the SXSW Interactive Festival,
  where innovators and technology enthusiasts come together to
  showcase their latest technologies from 3D printers to digital
  lightsabers.
</p>
<p>
  We had a great time at the event and met some amazing innovators!
  Below are some of the photos from our booth.

  SXSW can be an exhausting conference and attendees were flocking
  to the free espresso from our ARM mbed-enabled Coffee Machine
  Tracking System.

  Freescaleâ€™s Nerfinator that uses the mbed enabled FRDM-K64F was a
  big hit! We were dogging darts all weekend!

  We also setup programing stations for attendees to try out their
  first 'blinky' program.

  Last but certainly not least, Silicon Labs was demonstrating at
  their booth the <a href=
  "http://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/Silicon-Labs-Power-Management-APIs/">
  new low-power APIs</a> that were announced just before the event.
