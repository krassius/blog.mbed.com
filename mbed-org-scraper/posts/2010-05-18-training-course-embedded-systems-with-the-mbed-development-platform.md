<p>Rob at RT Sixty has sent us details of a professional Embedded Systems
  training course running in July in the UK. It is using mbed as the core
  platform, and looks like a great ground-up introduction to embedded systems.
  If you are starting to look at using MCUs in your company, it could certainly
  be worth a look.</p>
<p>Here are the details...</p>
