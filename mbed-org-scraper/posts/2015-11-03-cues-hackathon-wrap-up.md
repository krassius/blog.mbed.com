<p>Last weekend the mbed team was at the CUES Hackathon, the first ever ARM
  mbed wearable hackathon.</p>
<p>With 100 participants from the University of Cambridge, <a href="https://cuengineeringsociety.org.uk/events/cues-hackathon/"
  rel="nofollow">CUES Hackathon</a> was a great success. Over the course of
  24 hours, teams of student build amazing projects. The participants were
  given a <a href="http://redbearlab.com/blenano/" rel="nofollow">BLE Nano</a> development
  board from <a href="http://redbearlab.com/" rel="nofollow">RedBearLab</a> which
  contains a <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822"
  rel="nofollow">Nordic Semiconductor nRF51822 SoC</a> that enables Bluetooth&#xAE;
  Low Energy (BLE) communication with mobile phones and other BLE devices.</p>

  <p>Of all the projects, here are few that stood out.</p>
  <p><strong>First Prize winner:  Rowbot-Personalised Rowing Advice</strong>
They
    developed a miniature wireless device that attaches near the rower&#x2019;s
    wrist and streams real-time acceleration data to a mobile phone.</p>
  <p>The device can both analyze data by itself and give personalized advice,
    or can be used by the team coach to track the performance of the team.</p>
  <p>We were impressed with the completeness of their solution. It looked like
    a product that can be on the market within a week despite being made in
    the last 24 hours.</p>

  <p><strong>Runner-Up: Internet Of Decks: Clothing containing LED Strips which beat in time to music</strong>
  </p>
  <p>They developed clothing containing an embedded microcontroller and LED
    strips which beat in time to music. The LED Strips switch between many
    colours and flash in one of three patterns. A phone app is used to control
    when the device is on and which of the three patterns is used. Watch the
    video <a href="https://youtu.be/1LZBshc2_f4" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
  <p>We were impressed by the project&#x2019;s commercial potential. The unique
    perspective of letting the DJ control your wearable can open up new markets.</p>

  </p>
  <p><strong>Third Place: IoT Enabled Wearable SmartBin</strong>
  </p>
  <p>They developed a Bluetooth Low Energy based Smart Bin, which measures
    the mass and volume of rubbish contained inside.</p>
  <p>A companion smartphone app logs the data, renders beautiful graphs, and
    tweets passive-aggressively when the bin is full.</p>
  <p>Although the team took a playful approach to their product and presentation,
    a connected rubbish bin can have serious social consequences in real life.
    If the bins in each home can report how full it is, city council can optimise
    its pick up routine to reduce fuel consumption and labour costs. If people
    can track how much rubbish they are producing and compare to their peers,
    they can be motivated to reduce their waste production.</p>
