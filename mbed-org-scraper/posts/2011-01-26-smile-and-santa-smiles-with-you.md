<p>I just got a message about another video, now added to our channel; i&apos;m
  guessing this one was built over christmas!...</p>

<p>This video is from <a href="http://mbed.org/users/mrigsby/">Michael Rigsby</a> who
  built Santa as an entry for the Circuit Cellar Design Challenge. You can
  see more on his <a href="http://mbed.org/users/mrigsby/notebook/smile-and-santa-smiles-with-you/">notebook page</a>.</p>
<p>And on that note, the <a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/mbed-Design-Challenge">Circuit Cellar Design Challenge</a> deadline
  is only a month away, so if you are working on an entry it is time to get
  polishing! I look forward to seeing more videos of these projects in action!!</p>
