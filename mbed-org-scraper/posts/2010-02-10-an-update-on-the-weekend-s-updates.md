<p>To follow up to my <a href="http://mbed.org/blog/entry/115/">last post</a>:</p>
<p>The network upgrades went ahead as planned, hopefully without too much
  disruption. The server room now has a shiny new set of switches and firewalls
  which should serve us well.</p>
<p>I have also given our load balancer and cache a lot more RAM/CPU to play
  with.</p>
<p>As for the promised compiler updates, the more eagle eyed of you will
  have noticed that the compiler wasn&apos;t updated over the weekend. We
  had to postpone the update while some last minute issues were worked out.
  The good news is that the compiler update has now been applied.</p>
<p>Simon will be along in a moment with a post discussing the latest improvements
  to the mbed Compiler.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>
