  We are excited to share the Kickstarter launch of <a href=
  "https://www.ghielectronics.com/" rel="nofollow">GHI
  Electronic's</a> new mbed-enabled platform, <strong><a href=
  "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1359959821/mbuino-a-programmable-mbed-keychain"
  rel="nofollow">mBuino</a></strong>. mBuino is a programmable
  mbed-enabled keychain that features an ARM® Cortex™-M0 50Mhz,
  UART, SPI, and I2C.

  Don’t let the pint-sized design fool you, this little board can
  do so much more than make your keys look cool. To start you can
  easily make the on-board LEDs blink or you could get a bit more
  creative and create your own video game platform (joystick, color
  display and all)…check out the example they show in their
  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1359959821/mbuino-a-programmable-mbed-keychain"
  rel="nofollow">Kickstarter video</a>. It is even programmable
  with mbed. By simply connecting the mBuino to your computer, and
  using the mbed online compiler, you are able to easily write code
  and save your code to the device.

  This little ingenious idea came about as a ‘round table’ project
  from the engineers at GHI Electronics, LLC. They wanted to create
  something that reflects their passion for electronics…which I
  have to say, I think they have achieved! The profits from this
  Kickstarter will go to help funding their ‘<a href=
  "http://outrageouscircuits.com" rel=
  "nofollow">OutrageousCircuits.com</a>’ website which will allow
  this creative group of engineers a place to share more of their
  outrageous designs and products. This is just the beginning of
  their work on creating mbed development platforms and we are
  excited to see what they come up with next!
