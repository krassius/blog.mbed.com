<p>The Wallbot BLE (Bluetooth&#xAE; Low Energy) is a programmable mbed-enabled
  wheeled robotic kit that has the ability to not only drive on the ground,
  but walls as well. When the Wallbot BLE is place on a magnetic surface
  such as a whiteboard, fridge, etc., the robot can drive in the vertical
  direction. It is not an Arduino form factor platform, but you can use on-board
  sensor devices by your code.</p>
