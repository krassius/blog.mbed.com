  We're putting together a little demo using the new <a href=
  "/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC11U24">mbed NXP LPC11U24</a>. Here are a
  couple of shots of it in prototype:

  Can you guess what it is yet? :)

<p>
  We're working on it for Embedded World, so if we pull it off you
  should be able to see it on NXP's stand. Fingers crossed!
</p>
<p>
  btw. ARM will also be displaying some demos based on the mbed NXP
  LPC11U24; we've got two lined up already, but one slot is still
  free so if you have a project that could make a great demo, get
  in touch!
