<p>If you haven&apos;t seen these guys before, you really have to check them
  out. This is one of the best places we&apos;ve found on the net for getting
  hold of interesting modules and fiddly components on breakout boards.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve been using Sparkfun parts for a long time now to help test
  and refine mbed, so it is great to see it up there as one of them now :)</p>
<p>Thanks Sparkfun, for everything!</p>
