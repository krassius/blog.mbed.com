<p>The mbed platform hasn&apos;t been around long and it is still early days,
  but it is already proving a great success. We are therefore looking for
  some really talented engineers, who share our vision, to join the mbed
  team and make it even better...</p>
<p>We&apos;re looking for an embedded software wizard to work with us full
  time, and talented students or recent graduates for some industrial placements.</p>
<p>We&apos;re a small team and we need stand out people, so you need to stand
  out! So&#xA0;if you do apply, make sure you point me at your website or
  your github account and show me stuff you&apos;ve done. Or code or port
  something amazing to mbed that will demonstrate your skills. Tell me your
  ideas and how you&apos;d make mbed better.</p>
<p>For all the details and how to apply, see:</p>

  please pass it on!</p>
