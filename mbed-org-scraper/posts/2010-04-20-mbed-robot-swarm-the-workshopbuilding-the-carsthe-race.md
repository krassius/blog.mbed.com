    I just heard from Lucas that the mbed Robot Workshop featured
    in the&nbsp;Argentinian&nbsp;Symposium on Embedded Systems
    (SASE)&nbsp;will be running again!
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst we're waiting on details, here is what happened the
    first time...

    The Workshop
  </h2>
  <p>
    As part of SASE, Lucas, Joaquín and "Club de Robótica" put on a
    workshop to introduce embedded programming using mbed-powered
    line following robots. In 9 hours, attendees went from getting
    hold of the mbed for the first time and learning the basics to
    programming the control and algorithms for their robots.
  </p>
  <p>
    These robots were custom designs built by the team; and there
    was 25 of them! Thats a lot of building...
