<p>
  Just a note to say the compiler has had some updates which
  include a platform support upgrade!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Revised Platform Support:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firefox 2 and 3 on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS X and
  Linux&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 6 and 7 on Windows XP and Windows
  Vista&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So, go nuts with your new found freedom! And please tell us if
  you find bugs/problems/things not working how you'd expect
  :)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Hope you like it.
