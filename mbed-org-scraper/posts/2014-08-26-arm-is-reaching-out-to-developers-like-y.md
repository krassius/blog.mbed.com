<p>ARM is currently working on a project to better understand how to engage
  and collaborate with ARM developers through digital sites and communities.</p>
<p>We&apos;re really proud that the mbed community has become a great example
  of how this can work well, but I&apos;m also sure we could do better too.
  As such, I thought it&apos;d be really useful for mbed and ARM in general
  to hear what we could do to better support you. This is another opportunity
  to make working with mbed and ARM better!</p>
<p>We hope that you will be willing to complete this ARM survey, which should
  take around 15 minutes of your time. Please note that the survey will end
  on Tuesday 26th August:</p>
