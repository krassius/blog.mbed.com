  mbed may only be 2 months old, but things are going really well
  so we're planning for the future; that means we're looking for
  people to join the team!
</p>
<p>
  We've setup a jobs&nbsp;page which lists more details on the
  roles we're looking for, but here is the summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ninja microcontroller coder to work with us on libraries,
  middleware, toolchains, etc; this is a <strong>Full Time</strong>
  role, starting as a <strong>Contractor</strong> with a view to
  employment
  </li>
  <li>Undergraduates or recent graduates to work on peripheral
  hardware, libraries and projects using mbed to pro-actively
  support our users; this would be as&nbsp;<strong>3-12 month
  full-time</strong> internships
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  An important note: We're based in&nbsp;<strong>Cambridge,
  UK</strong>, so please only apply if you are from the area, or
  willing to commute or move here!
</p>
<p>
  For the full details, and the links to apply, take a look at the
