<p>It has been really great to see the response that the mbed Microcontroller
  form-factor has been getting. We spent a lot of time researching, testing
  and trialing prototypes to end up with what we have now, and it is good
  to know the effort was worthwhile. On our wall are all the different mbed
  prototypes, and it is funny to look at e.g. the one that is 2-eurocards
  big, and see how our thinking changed over time as we tried things out
  in the field. I&apos;ll perhaps write them up at some point...</p>
<p>But we do still sometimes get asked why mbed doesn&apos;t have a screen?
  Or a certain connector? Or a flavour-of-the-month peripheral chip? There
  are obviously lots of factors why we haven&apos;t gone that route, and
  here is a good example of one of those reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Baseboards!</strong>
</p>
<p>Check out this mbed-compatible baseboards that <a href="http://www.embeddedartists.com">Embedded Artists</a> have
  just announced:</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the specs, it&apos;s got OLED screen, SPI SD card socket and
  Flash, I2C port expander, accelerometer and light sensor, joystick, push
  button and rotary switches, XBee, Ethernet and CAN sockets. Sounds like
  a great mix of peripherals.</p>
<p>We&apos;ve used Embedded Artists stuff before and always been very pleased
  with the quality, so whilst we haven&apos;t got hold of one yet so can&apos;t
  fully comment, if you want to try it out yourself it looks like you can

  href="http://www.embeddedartists.com/shop/updatecart.php?action=buy&amp;art=EA-XPR-021&amp;num=1&amp;page=/products/lpcxpresso/xpr_base.php">pre-order the Embedded Artists baseboard</a>and get it some time in January.</p>
<p>Great job EA!</p>
