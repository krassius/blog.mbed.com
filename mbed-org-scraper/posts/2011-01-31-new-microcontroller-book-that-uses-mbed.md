<p>
  For anyone who might be a beginner to C and Microcontrollers,
  Elektor have just published a book called "ARM Microcontrollers
  (part 1) - 35 projects for beginners"...
</p>
<p>
  Mine just arrived in the post, so here is a sneak peak:

  You can see the mbed in the little circle at the bottom.
  Apparently this photo was taken outside the old castle that
  Elektor is based in!

  Here is a look at the contents page to give you an idea of the
  skill level it is aimed at:

  You can find it on the Elektor website, and they are even selling
  it with a little starter kit bundle so it could be a great intro
  for someone wanting to get started.
