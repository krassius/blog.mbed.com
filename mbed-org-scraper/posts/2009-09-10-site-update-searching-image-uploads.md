<p>You asked for it, you got it. There is now a search engine for mbed!</p>
<p>The search engine is limited in one way however; it does not search within
  the Handbook or Cookbook. This should hopefully be solved with the next
  major update.</p>
<p>Also, you can now easily upload images to attach to your forum posts.</p>
<p>To upload an image, just click the image icon at the top of the forum
  editor box, then click the &apos;Browse&apos; icon next to the URL field.</p>
<p>As always, feedback is very welcome.</p>
<p>Dan</p>
