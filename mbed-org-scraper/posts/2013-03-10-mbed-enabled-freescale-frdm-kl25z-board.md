<p>We&apos;re very pleased to announce the new mbed-enabled Freescale FRDM-KL25Z
  board!</p>
<p><a href="http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-FRDM-KL25Z"><img src="https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/simon/xslide-01a.png.pagespeed.ic.iitG8XqQYk.png" alt="FRDM-KL25Z is now mbed-enabled" title="FRDM-KL25Z is now mbed-enabled"></a>
</p>
<p>We&apos;ve been working with Freescale on the development of their new
  range of ultra-low-cost boards, and from today you can upgrade them for
  free to be mbed-enabled and get free access to the mbed online compiler
  and development platform.</p>
<p>It is great to be able to welcome Freescale to the mbed project!</p>
 <h2>About the FRDM-KL25Z board</h2>

<p>The FRDM-KL25Z Freescale Freedom development board uses the Kinetis L
  series of MCUs, the industry&#x2019;s first microcontrollers built on the
  ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#x2122;-M0+ core. The board is based on the KL25Z128VLK,
  a tiny KL2 family device that runs at 48 MHz, has 128 KB of flash, a full-speed
  USB controller and various analog and digital peripherals. The FRDM-KL25Z
  hardware is form-factor compatible with the Arduino&#x2122; R3 pin layout,
  so it&apos;ll work with lots of existing shield designs. The board includes
  some bonus features of an RGB LED, a 3-axis digital accelerometer and a
  capacitive touch slider.</p>

<h2>Freescale FRDM-KL25Z supported in the mbed platform!</h2>

<p>We&apos;ve been working with Freescale to add support in the mbed SDK,
  HDK and Online Tools for the KL25Z, so now you can use the FRDM-KL25Z board
  with the mbed development platform for free!</p>
<p>We&apos;ll be introducing additional mbed-enabled development platforms
  from Freescale (and others) in 2013.</p>

<h2>Get yours now!</h2>
