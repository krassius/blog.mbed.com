<p>We are excited to announce our collaboration with <a href="http://news.silabs.com/press-release/product-news/silicon-labs-and-arm-collaborate-drive-future-low-power-arm-mbed-iot-devi"
  rel="nofollow">Silicon Labs to bring power management APIs to mbed</a>.
  The new APIs will enable mbed developers to optimize their mbed-enabled
  designs for the utmost energy efficiency and longer battery life.</p>

  <p>One major benefit of the power management APIs is the ability to reduce
    system-level energy consumption by automatically determining and enabling
    the optimal sleep mode based on the MCU peripherals in use. For developers
    this is can help to significantly reduce the energy consumption of their
    IoT applications with minimal effort.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/?tvend=20">mbed-enabled EFM32 Gecko starter kits</a> are
    planned to be released in April of this year. Silicon Labs&#x2019; initial
    platforms supporting mbed will include 4 starter kits (Wonder Gecko, Leopard
    Gecko, Giant Gecko and Zero Gecko). Developers with existing <a href="http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/32-bit/Pages/32-bit-microcontrollers.aspx"
    rel="nofollow">EFM32 kits</a> will be able to mbed-enable their hardware
    through a simple software update.</p>

    a real-world scenario where using theses APIs can improve current consumption.</p>
