<p>Just to let you know, we&apos;ll be at ARM Techcon in Santa Clara this
  week:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.armtechcon3.com/2009/"><img alt="" height="280" src="https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/simon/336x280x336x280.jpg.pagespeed.ic.JQRoB1f-em.jpg" width="336"></a>
</p>
<p>If you are in the area, please come along and find us if you get the chance;
  it&apos;d be great to chat, especially if you already got hold of an mbed
  or know what your plans are when yours comes through!</p>
<p>NXP should be doing a demo session on Thursday too (~1pm), so if mbed
  is new to you it may be a great way of getting an intro.</p>
<p>See you there,</p>
<p>Simon</p>
