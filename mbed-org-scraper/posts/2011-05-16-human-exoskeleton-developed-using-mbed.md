  After student Austin Whitney was paralysed in a car accident, a
  few <a href=
  "http://bleex.me.berkeley.edu/research/exoskeleton/medical-exoskeleton/"
  rel="nofollow">graduate students</a> under Professor Homayoon
  Kazerooni at Berkeley took on the challenge to get him walking
  again.
</p>
<p>
  The team have built a low cost personal mobility human
  exoskeleton, designed and constructed at a fraction of the cost
  of current designs.

  What's the relevance to mbed? From the video below you can get a
  couple of <a href=
  "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIY087k7tCk&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#at=20"
  rel="nofollow">glimpses</a> which suggest it is designed around
  two mbed boards!

  Job well done, and perhaps we might even see a cookbook article
  out of it from the team.
