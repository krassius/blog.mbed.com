  follows a project example from concept through to prototype, showing how
  mbed could help at the rapid prototyping stage of a project.&quot;</p>
<p>The details for the webinar can be found at:</p>

</ul>
<p>Element-14 also has mbed on a <a href="http://www.element-14.com/community/view-event.jspa?event=2604">Road Test</a> for
  registered road test users, so worth having a look.</p>
<p>This should be a great introduction for anyone who has not yet seen the
  mbed tools in action yet, and wants to find out more. Pass it on!</p>
