<p>I&apos;m happy to announce that we are now accepting beta testers for
  our new collaboration infrastructure!</p>
<p><a href="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/dan/repository.png"><img width="500" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot" src="https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/dan/500xNxrepository.png.pagespeed.ic.XdlfgQ3jMs.png"></a>
</p>
<p>This is a major update for mbed, introducing fully integrated support
  for code collaboration within the mbed Compiler and Website.</p>
 <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The collaboration infrastructure is based on the distributed version control
  model (DVCS), and allows creation, sharing and collaboration on code repositories
  hosted on mbed. This enables lots of useful workflows, like allowing you
  to work with a group of developers on a shared codebase, or to publish
  and share a library, and pull fixes and improvements other developers might
  suggest.</p>
<p>Some feature highlights include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating new public repositories directly from the mbed Compiler</li>
  <li>Shared repositories allowing other users to commit to your public repository</li>
  <li>Forking of repositories that are trackable and mergable with the original
    repository</li>
  <li>Full support for pulling, pushing, forking and merging within the Compiler
    IDE</li>
  <li>Activity streams to follow repositories you are interested in</li>
  <li>Integrated repository wikis to document your project</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&apos;d like to read more about the collaboration system, we have
  started to publish details at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mbed.org/handbook/Collaboration">http://mbed.org/handbook/Collaboration</a>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>We&apos;ll be sharing more details as we progress through the beta.</p>

<h2>Applying for the Beta</h2>

<p>We&apos;ve successfully completed all our internal rounds of testing,
  so are now expanding the beta trials wider. We&apos;ll be limiting numbers
  initially so you&apos;ll need to contact us to enable your account to access
  the beta.</p>
<p>To apply for the beta, you will need to email us at <strong><a href="mailto:support@mbed.org">support@mbed.org</a></strong> stating
  your interest in collaborative version control - perhaps you&apos;re part
  of a group which want to collaborate on a program, or publishing a library
  that you want to accept fixes back it to? We&apos;re looking for a range
  of users to get feedback from groups who are using the system in different
  ways. After you email us, we&apos;ll send you instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest!</p>
