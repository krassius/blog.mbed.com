<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is an update on the&#xA0;<a href="/blog/entry/23/">site upgrade</a>,
  which is now complete!</p>
<p>What&apos;s changed:</p>
<p>New domain - mbed.org is our new home, which better reflects our increasingly
  international userbase. mbed.co.uk will continue to work as a redirect
  for the forseeable future.</p>
<p>You may notice that mbed can now support multiple microcontroller boards,
  this is because a new board is on it&apos;s way!</p>
<p>New servers and architecture. Hopefully mbed should now feel faster than
  ever, and will have plenty of capacity to support future growth.</p>
<p>And finally, there is a sprinkling of several small improvements and additional
  features, as well as groundwork laid for future feature additions.</p>
<p>This work is all in preparation for going fully public and opening the
  whole site to the world, which will happen very soon now. In the meantime,
  you are now all free to talk about mbed as much as you like! We have put
  a Tour on the front page (visible to non-logged-in users) which is fully
  public knowledge, so you can link to that for now if you need to explain
  to someone what mbed is all about.</p>
<p>If you spot any bugs/problems after the site upgrade, please add them
  to&#xA0;<a href="http://mbed.org/forum/topic/83/">http://mbed.org/forum/topic/83/</a>
</p>
<p>Once again, I should mention I have taken the liberty of turning on site
  update email notification for all beta testers. If for any reason you wish
  to opt out of receiving these emails, just untick the box in the My Account
  area (<a href="/accounts/profile/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0073bd !important;">http://mbed.org/accounts/profile/</a>).</p>
<p>Have fun,</p>
<p>Dan</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
