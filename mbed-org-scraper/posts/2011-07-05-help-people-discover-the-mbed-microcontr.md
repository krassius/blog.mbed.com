<p>
  For a bit of promotional fun to help more people discover mbed, I
  thought I'd have a little prize draw.

</p>
<p>
  By the end of the week, I'm going to choose 5 tweeters at random
  who tweet:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Check out the mbed Microcontroller, and retweet this for
  a chance to win one! <a href="http://bit.ly/mPAKOz" rel=
  "nofollow">http://bit.ly/mPAKOz</a>"</strong>
</p>
<p>
  ..and send them a free mbed! To make it easy, you can just click
  below to tweet the message and enter :)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tweet: <a href=
  "http://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20the%20mbed%20Microcontroller,%20and%20retweet%20this%20for%20a%20chance%20to%20win%20one!%20http://bit.ly/mPAKOz"
    rel="nofollow">Check out the mbed Microcontroller, and retweet
    this for a chance to win one! http:<em>bit.ly/mPAKOz</em></a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So, what is the idea?!
</p>
<p>
  Well, it turns out most people find out about mbed by chance
  through being mentioned by a friend or collegue. They then look
  it up, see it can really help them, we sell a board and a new
  member of the community joins us! We really like that sort of
  introduction, and it is probably a good reason for the quality of
  the engineers turning up in the forums.
</p>
<p>
  So this little promotion helps you help a few more people hear
  about mbed through the medium of twitter and prizes. Hopefully
  some will discover mbed can help them, we'll sell a few more
  boards, and the talent pool in our community will grow even
  further! And 5 will win one!
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't looked recently at how the community is growing,
  take a look at the mbed world map showing some of you that have
  shared your location in your profile:

  If mbed is new to you, why not have a look around the site to get
  a feel for what it is about; things like the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/cookbook">Cookbook</a> are great for getting a
  feel of what you can do. Checkout the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/handbook/Tour">tour</a> for an overview of why
  mbed may and may not be what you are after; if it might, you can
  buy one through the <a href="http://mbed.org/order">order
  page</a>.

<p>
  Good luck and happy tweeting!
