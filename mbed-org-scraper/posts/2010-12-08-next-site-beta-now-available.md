<p>The next version of the mbed website is now available for beta testing.
  Here is what we&apos;ve added...</p>
<p>First up, the published program/library pages have been improved to give
  a nice overview. In particular, if the library is documented, you&apos;ll
  see that turn up on the frontpage, plus a list of the files it contains.
  This makes it much nicer to see and explore a published code example:</p>

</p>
<p>In addition, there is now a &quot;relationship engine&quot;. This shows
  you what is related to the code you are looking at, such as the programs
  it is used within, and the wiki pages that talk about it. This should make
  it really easy to find what other information and documentation is available
  about some code, plus examples that use it:</p>

  style="border: 1px solid black;" width="288">
</p>
<p>We&apos;ve also added a &quot;Code&quot; page, where you can browse published
  programs and libraries. These can be sorted by various things, including
  a general score based on the quality/usage of the library; as the stats
  build up, this should provide a good way to find quality libraries to use:</p>

  style="border: 1px solid black;" width="764">
</p>
<p>The notebooks and forums are upgraded to use the wiki syntax. This means
  you&apos;ll now get the power of our wiki engine throughout the site.</p>
<p>A few updates on the compiler too. It now includes search and replace,
  including regular expression based search:</p>

  style="border: 1px solid black;" width="607">
</p>
<p>The compiler also adds a Print button to allow you to print a file with
  full-syntax highlighting.</p>
