<p>
  After a lot of work, we've just released a major update to
  the&nbsp;libraries (v5). Hopefully, you'll hardly notice...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The majority of this upgrade is totally behind the scenes,
  getting the&nbsp;core robust and ready for the things we want to
  do with the API now&nbsp;and in the future. Whilst it shouldn't
  really be visible, please tell&nbsp;us if we break any of your
  code when you upgrade! Our next focus with&nbsp;the Libraries
  will be on the API itself, so expect some slightly
  more&nbsp;invasive improvements then. And some of the new tricks
  to come to&nbsp;light :)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  ...but we couldn't do an update without giving you something new!
  So&nbsp;in addition to the new Ticker and Timeout classes, we've
  added file&nbsp;system access to the USB drive. No documentation
  yet, but the API page&nbsp;should give you a clue:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  http://mbed.co.uk/projects/libraries/api/mbed/trunk/LocalFileSystem&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We think this might find some good applications, so we're
  interested&nbsp;to hear how you use it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  When you start a new project, you will automatically pull in the
  new&nbsp;v5 mbed Library. For existing projects, clicking on the
  mbed library&nbsp;in your file tree should provide you with an
  "update" button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  As ever, please bring to our attention any problems or questions
  you&nbsp;have.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Have Fun!<br>
  Simon
