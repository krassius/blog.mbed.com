<p>After a lot of work, we&apos;ve just released a major update to the&#xA0;libraries
  (v5). Hopefully, you&apos;ll hardly notice...&#xA0;</p>
<p>The majority of this upgrade is totally behind the scenes, getting the&#xA0;core
  robust and ready for the things we want to do with the API now&#xA0;and
  in the future. Whilst it shouldn&apos;t really be visible, please tell&#xA0;us
  if we break any of your code when you upgrade! Our next focus with&#xA0;the
  Libraries will be on the API itself, so expect some slightly more&#xA0;invasive
  improvements then. And some of the new tricks to come to&#xA0;light :)&#xA0;</p>
<p>...but we couldn&apos;t do an update without giving you something new!
  So&#xA0;in addition to the new Ticker and Timeout classes, we&apos;ve added
  file&#xA0;system access to the USB drive. No documentation yet, but the
  API page&#xA0;should give you a clue:&#xA0;</p>
<p>http://mbed.co.uk/projects/libraries/api/mbed/trunk/LocalFileSystem&#xA0;</p>
<p>We think this might find some good applications, so we&apos;re interested&#xA0;to
  hear how you use it.&#xA0;</p>
<p>When you start a new project, you will automatically pull in the new&#xA0;v5
  mbed Library. For existing projects, clicking on the mbed library&#xA0;in
  your file tree should provide you with an &quot;update&quot; button.&#xA0;</p>
<p>As ever, please bring to our attention any problems or questions you&#xA0;have.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Have Fun!
  <br>Simon</p>
