  April of this year the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/blog/entry/Freescale-FRDM-K64F-ARM-Cortex-M4/">FRDM-K64F</a>
  development platform was released with mbed support and we were
  pretty excited to welcome the platform into the community. It has
  tons of connectivity options including Ethernet and expansion
  headers for a 2.4GHz RF module and Bluetooth. There has been some
  great work being done with this platform, so Freescale wanted to
  give you all a chance to win a <a href=
  "http://sites.garmin.com/forerunner10/" rel="nofollow">Garmin
  Forerunner 10 watch</a> for your work!
</p>
<p>
  The contest guidelines are pretty simple. <strong>Just join the
  mbed team “<a href=
  "http://mbed.org/teams/FRDM-K64F-Code-Share/">FRDM-K64F Code
  Share</a>” and contribute your cool code to the team for
  automatic entry into the drawing.</strong> Two lucky participants
  will receive a Garmin Forerunner 10 watch that tells you how far
  and how fast you have run. Entries will be accepted for the
  contest from July 24, 2014 through to August 8, 2014. The rest of
  the community will benefit from seeing what you’ve been working
  on! Your submission may even end up as a getting started example
  for this platform and possibly future Freescale Freedom platforms
  as well.
</p>
