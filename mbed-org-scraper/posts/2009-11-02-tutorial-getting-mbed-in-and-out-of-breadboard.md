<p>Someone recently commented that once an mbed was in breadboard, it was
  a little tricky to get out. I&apos;ve also seen a few cases in workshops
  where examples wern&apos;t working for people, and it was simply due to
  the mbed not being pushed in to the breadboard properly (usually because
  it is stiff, and the user didn&apos;t want to damage anything - better
  to be careful!).</p>
<p>So here are a couple of videos with some simple recommendations. Firstly,
  getting your mbed in to the breadboard:</p>
<p>
  <object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/ksLhXegxW6c" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"

  </object>
</p>
<p>Secondly, getting it back out:</p>
<p>
  <object data="http://www.youtube.com/v/gfwkgxS9fhQ" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
  width="425">
    <param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gfwkgxS9fhQ">
  </object>
</p>
<p>For removal, the emphasis is on working it out slowly with light pressure
  to avoid bending pins, and ensuring you only press the shaft of the screwdriver
  against the edge of the mbed and the tip against the breadboard by pulling
  up. If you push down, you&apos;ll scrape the underside of the mbed with
  the screwdriver tip which will not be good news!</p>
<p>So use these simple approaches, take your time, and treat the hardware
  with care, and you&apos;ll be fine!</p>
