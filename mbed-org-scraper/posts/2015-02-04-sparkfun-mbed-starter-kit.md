<p>Late last year Sparkfun introduced the &#x2018;<a href="https://sparkfun.com/mbedkit"
  rel="nofollow">mbed Starter Kit</a>&#x2019; and it&apos;s finally back
  in stock! This kit was pulled together in conjunction with <a href="http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~hamblen/mbed/mbed_inventors_kit.htm"
  rel="nofollow">Georgia Tech who use if for several classes</a> and is designed
  to be an introduction to microcontroller based electronics! The kit includes
  the <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/">LPC1768 platform</a> and
  all the components necessary to complete <a href="https://sparkfun.com/mbedkit"
  rel="nofollow">10 tutorials</a> created by SparkFun. Best of all, no soldering
  is required!</p>

<p>The tutorials cover embedded concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>LEDs (what good microcontroller project doesn&apos;t?)</li>
  <li>Pulse-width modulation (PWM)</li>
  <li>Interrupt-driven events</li>
  <li>LCD graphics</li>
  <li>Communication protocols (I2C, SPI, and UART)</li>
  <li>Sensors (accelerometer and temperature)</li>
  <li>Connecting to the Internet (IoT)</li>
  <li>USB (device and host)</li>
  <li>Logging data to an SD card</li>
  <li>Playing sounds</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A keyboard and an Ethernet-based Internet connection are needed
  for two of the tutorials.</p>
<p>The kit can be purchased <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12968"
  rel="nofollow">from Sparkfun</a> and is a great introduction to mbed. Many
  of the concepts from the tutorials can be integrated into your own <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/cookbook/Student-Projects">microcontroller projects.</a>
