<p>Sixth former Will Reynolds from The Perse School in Cambridge won the
  &apos;Google Technology Trailblazer Prize&apos; at the <a href="http://www.thebigbangfair.co.uk/">Big Bang 2010</a> science
  fair in Manchester last Friday for his mbed based mimicking robot arm.</p>
<p
class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">The aim of the fair is to inspire a wide range of people to engage with
  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText"
  style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">&#xA0;</p>
  <p class="MsoPlainText" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Will&apos;s exhibited project was a mimicking robotic arm, that sensed
    and recreated the rotational movements of a user&apos;s hand through the
    use of MEMS sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. He created his
    project during his Nuffield Science Placement with the mbed team last summer.</p>

    <p>Will has the opportunity to spend two days at one of the Google research
      sites in Europe where he will be able to take part in tours, workshops
      and get involved in some hands-on work.</p>
