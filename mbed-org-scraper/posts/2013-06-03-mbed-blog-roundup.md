<p>
  A lot has been going on recently at mbed! Here is a roundup of
  what's been happening:
</p>
<h3>
  New Issue Trackers and Pull Requests!
</h3>
<p>
  We've been adding some features to make working together on mbed
  even easier!
</p>
<p>
  You can now add an issue tracker to your repositories. We've
  already enabled it on the official mbed repositories. <a href=
  "/blog/entry/Issue-Tracker/">read more</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Pull Requests are now being built-in to the workflows and are
  available in mbed betamode. <a href=
  "/blog/entry/Pull-Requests-now-in-beta/">read more</a>.
</p>
<h3>
  CMSIS-DAP debug on all mbed-enabled hardware!
</h3>
<p>
  CMSIS-DAP support has been added for all mbed board firmware, so
  you can now debug your mbed hardware using a range of well known
  toolchains. <a href=
  "/blog/entry/Debugging-on-mbed-enabled-platforms/">read more</a>
</p>
<p>
  We've also released an open source python interface to allow
  debugging Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP, either using
  GDB or your own custom scripts. <a href=

<h3>
  Professional and Academic Microcontroller Training based on mbed!
</h3>
<p>
  Providers of embedded software training <a href=
  "http://feabhas.com/" rel="nofollow">Feabhas</a> have chosen mbed
  as a platform for their professional training courses. <a href=
  "/blog/entry/mbed-professional-training-platform/">read more</a>.
</p>
<p>
  ARM is running a free of charge, one-day microcontroller workshop
  at the ARM headquarters in Cambridge for academic teaching staff.

<h3>
  mbed Application Board on sale!
</h3>
<p>
  The mbed application board went on sale in March and is selling
  like hotcakes! The credit card size application board provides a
  variety of peripherals which there are libraries and example code
  for in the <a href=
  "/cookbook/mbed-application-board">cookbook</a> so it is a great
  self contained development or training companion. <a href=

<h3>
  Xively collaboration for building the Internet of Things!
</h3>
<p>
  We've been working with <a href="http://xively.com" rel=
  "nofollow">xively</a> (formerly Cosm/Pachube) to launch their new
  IoT platform and Xively Jumpstart kit so you can rapidly
  prototype connected devices and co-develop IoT solutions.
