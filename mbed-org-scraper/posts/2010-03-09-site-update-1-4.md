  the following requested features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Favouriting</li>

</p>
<p>To bookmark a handy forum thread, program, page or even user, simply click
  the star
  <img alt="" height="16" src="http://mbed.org/media/img/icons/greystar.png"
  width="16">icon. You can see all your favourites in your <em>My Home </em>area. This
  will form the basis of more interesting things to come regarding ranking
  of items.</p>
<p><strong>Private messaging</strong>
</p>
<p>On any user&apos;s home page, simply click <strong>send private message</strong>,
  and you can send that user an email. Your email address will not be revealed
  to the user you are messaging.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
