<h3>
  Dude Where's my Car?
</h3>
<p>
  <br>
  After a hard night of hacking a big congratulations to the 'Dude
  Where's My Car' prototype.
</p>
<p>
  Ali Bros &amp; Dylan Jones developed a journey tracking
  'blackbox' that can be fitted in a car, which uses the Vodafone
  K3770 USB 3G modem to upload live tracking data to a host, which
  connects with Facebook.
</p>
<p>
  The hardware features a GPS module and OBD (On-board diagnostics)
  interface for collecting critical parameters from an engine
  management system, and capable of uploading data over 3G during a
  typical road trip.
</p>
<p>
  The host site allows a user to connect to facebook and provide
  updates to your profile, and share info about your trip with your
  friend <a href="http://dudewheresmycar.me/" rel=
  "nofollow">http://dudewheresmycar.me/</a>
</p>
<p>
  So after a lot of hard work, dedication and sleep deprivation to
  have a functional prototype is amazing stuff. Ali and Dylan won
  both the The Vodafone Embedded Hardware Hack Challenge and the
  Facebook Open Graph Challenge <a href=
