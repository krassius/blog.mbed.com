<p>
  To support the continuing growth of mbed storage upgrades will be
  performed on 6th of August starting at 0645 UTC (0745 BST, 1500
  JST, 2300 Aug 5th PST)
</p>
<p>
  developer.mbed.org will be unavailable from 0645 UTC, work is
  anticipated to be complete by 0900 UTC.
</p>
<p>
  The growth of developer.mbed.org means we have outgrown our
  current storage infrastructure. Switching to new infrastructure
  will give us more storage and will simplify future growth. We
  recognise this will be an inconvenience to our users and hope you
  understand that this is necessary.
</p>
<p>
  This maintenance was initially planned for the 4th but has been
  rescheduled.
</p>
