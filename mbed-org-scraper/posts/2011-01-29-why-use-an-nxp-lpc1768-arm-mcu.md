  If you ever need to explain to someone why they should be using
  an NXP LPC1768 ARM Cortex MCU in their next product, as found on
  mbed, just send them this video!...

  (I think) this was created by <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/users/ccutchy/">ccutchy</a>. Even if you don't
  speak Japanese, it certainly gets the message across! Brilliant.

  ...this is the first song i've ever seen about an ARM MCU. Anyone
  want to make an mbed music video? :)
