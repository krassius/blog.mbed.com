<p>After a very inspiring and sleepless weekend at the <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/ATT-Code-for-Car-and-home/">AT&amp;T Hackathon &#x2013; Code for Car and Home</a> in
  September, we have gathered <a href="http://freescale.com/" rel="nofollow">Freescale Semiconductor</a>,
  <a
  href="http://multitech.com/" rel="nofollow">Multi-Tech Systems</a>, <a href="http://www.nordicsemi.com/" rel="nofollow">Nordic Semiconductor</a>,
    <a
    href="http://st.com/" rel="nofollow">ST Microelectronics</a>, <a href="http://developer.mbed.org/blog/entry/ATT-Code-for-Car-and-home/www.ublox.com/">u-blox</a> and
      ARM back together again to form <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ATT-Hackathon/">&#x2018;Team mbed</a>.&#x2019;

      choose from based on your I/O and connectivity needs (Bluetooth&#xAE;,
      cellular, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi&#xAE;). This event is a great place for developers
      to explore new hardware, experiment with innovative ideas and get guidance
      from the experts&#x2026;not to mention the great food and grand prizes!
      This year the first place winner will be taking home $25,000 USD, second
      place with $10,000 USD and third place with $5,000 USD!</p>
<p>We are giving first priority to our sensor and actuator collection to
  those whom complete our form to help identify the best hardware and components
  for your project. Fill out the form <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1h_Sby4At2G5FMssy_MhNHHnE9VC0yUKUYEtS5uvYpCQ/viewform" rel="nofollow">here</a></strong>!</p>
