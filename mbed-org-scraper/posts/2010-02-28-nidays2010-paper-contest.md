<p>I just had an email land in my inbox from National Instruments advertising
  a &quot;Paper Contest&quot; for an event called NIDays2010:</p>
<p><a href="http://digital.ni.com/worldwide/uk.nsf/web/all/63E97E35FA3B107B802572C60043633C"><img alt="" height="155" src="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/simon/nidays-10.gif" width="550"></a>
</p>
<p>It looks like they are offering prizes for papers written about projects
  using NI software (things like LabView) in interesting ways. If there are
  any LabView gurus out there (or gurus in training), perhaps an mbed + LabView
  combo could make a really interesting entry?! And the prizes include a
  LEGO mindstorms!</p>
<p>Here is the main blurb for the competition:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Submit your most innovative solution for measurement and automation
    to the NIDays 2010 Paper Contest &#x2013; the technical paper contest that
    showcases the most innovative uses of virtual instrumentation and Graphical
    System Design in teaching or research as well as from engineers in industry.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&apos;d be great to see some projects using mbed and LabView together,
  and there must be scope for doing some really new and innovative things.
  For the full details, see:</p>

</ul>
<p>If anyone does decide to enter, please keep us up to date on how you get
  on.</p>
<p>p.s. if you are a student with a great idea for entering this&#xA0;competition,
  but you don&apos;t have your own mbed yet, we&apos;ll consider sponsoring
  a few of the most interesting and worthy projects;&#xA0;email us at&#xA0;
  <a
  href="mailto:sponsorship@mbed.org">sponsorship@mbed.org</a>with your proposal and we&apos;ll pick a few of
    the best to sponsor with an mbed to help get your idea off the ground.</p>
