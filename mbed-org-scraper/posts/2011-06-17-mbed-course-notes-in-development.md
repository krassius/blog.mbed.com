<p>Rob Toulson from Anglia Ruskin University and Tim Wilmshurst from University
  of Derby are working on developing some course notes to support lectures,
  workshops and self-learning using mbed. They&apos;ve now started to post
  some of the drafts online, and are encouraging feedback to help with development.
  Take a look at what they have so far:</p>
<p><a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/Course-Notes"><img src="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/robt/analog_input_and_output_scaled.png" alt="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/robt/analog_input_and_output_scaled.png" title="http://mbed.org/media/uploads/robt/analog_input_and_output_scaled.png"></a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://mbed.org/cookbook/Course-Notes">Course Notes</a>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>The notes are in the form of presentation slides, with the idea being
  they can be used as standalone pre-developed content such as for a workshops,
  as well as being a good base to build on to take things further with extended
  topics and projects for teaching.</p>
<p>They&apos;ve already posted a provisional content outline of the course
  notes so there is a good feel for what they are working on; ten topics
  to support a 12 week undergraduate course or a workshop run over a few
  days.</p>
<p>There are also 2 draft slide sets posted so far, and they&apos;ve said
  more will be posted as they are developed. So feel free to tell them if
  and where you&apos;d use them (encouragement, context), how they might
  be improved (content, applicability), and any other feedback you think
  they&apos;d find useful.</p>
<p>And there is word of a book to support them if there is interest, which
  sounds great!</p>
