# mbed Developer blog

This contains all posts from mbed.org and mbed.com in one handy repository.

## How to run

1. Have ruby installed
2. Run `bundle`
3. Run `jekyll serve`

## Todo

* Steal the layout from blog.mbed.com
* Implement pagination in similar fashion as old mbed blog
* Take the first two paragraphs or something of articles and use that on the frontpage, so it won't look so empty
* Scrape all the images out of the posts. I already made all images absolute, so they work, but I would like to have them in this repo.
