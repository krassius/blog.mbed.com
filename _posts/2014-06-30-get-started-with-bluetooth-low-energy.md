  If you have been working with the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51822/">Nordic nRF51822</a>
  platform or mbed's Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) API, then you
  probably have come across some of <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/users/ktownsend/">Kevin Townsend's</a> work on
  the mbed community. Recently I got a chance to catch up with him
  to find out more about the book he recently co-authored and
  published, ‘<a href=
  "http://www.microbuilder.eu/Blog/14-04-29/Getting_Started_with_Bluetooth_Low_Energy.aspx"
  rel="nofollow">Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy</a>,’
  with Carles Cufi, Robert Davidson and Akiba. This book does a
  good job of explaining the basic concepts of Bluetooth Low Energy
  (LE), its history and it simplifies the concepts and vocabulary
  used around Bluetooth LE for all developers wanting to get
  started with this new ultra low power wireless technology.

  Kevin said, one of the reasons he decided to contribute to this
  book, is that he finds the Internet of Things (IoT) and the
  Bluetooth LE technology trend to be particularly interesting; in
  that it has never been easier for small companies and hobbyist
  engineers to successfully make innovative products without large
  financial backing and lots of development resources. This is in
  part due to Bluetooth SIG's decision to add Bluetooth LE to the
  standard (BT 4.0 onwards), allowing many of the barriers to
  developing with this technology to be removed for hardware and
  software developers. This is also, one of the reasons why he
  chose to identify the mbed platform as a useful tool to create
  customized firmware for Bluetooth LE peripherals within Chapter
  10 of the book. As much of the mbed community knows well, “many
  of the messy firmware implementation issues and setup problems
  are conveniently buried in the easy-to-use online tools and
  high-level APIs,” not requiring familiarity with configuring an
  embedded toolchain or prior knowledge of working with embedded
  hardware.

  Additionally the book describes a sample project with the
  mbed-enabled <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51822/">Nordic nRF51822</a>
  platform to show you how to apply the concepts learned within the
  book in the real world.
