<p>
  It is always great to see real-life implementations of connected
  solutions that utilize mbed! Last week at <a href=
  "http://www.eeliveshow.com/sanjose/" rel="nofollow">EE Live!</a>
  in San Jose, California, <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/users/xively/">Xively</a> was showing off their
  complete industrial liquids monitor and control system that is
  using an <a href="http://mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/">NXP
  LPC1768</a> board running mbed to connect to Xivelyâ€™s cloud
  services via the internet, and uses Google Glass to access the
  application (in the video: the tablet shows the same view as the
  Google Glass) all to monitor the fluid levels and control the
  pump filing the tank in real-time. The NXP LPC1768 board is based
  on the ARM Cortex-M3 processor.
