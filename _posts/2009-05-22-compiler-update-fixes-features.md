<p>
  Just to let you know, the compiler has just undergone some
  updates...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Most notably, this should fix a bug we've seen a few of you
  report&nbsp;around reliability of the compile/download button.
  This was causing&nbsp;the compiler to intermittently hang, which
  is really bad news! This&nbsp;should now have been
  squished!&nbsp;If you do find any reliability problems,
  especially compiler hangs or&nbsp;failed download, please make
  sure you tell us! This is not acceptable&nbsp;behaviour so we
  want to know if it happens. Thank you to those who&nbsp;reported
  the previous bug, and hopefully you will no longer see
  these&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Also in this update:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Find" within a file (click the find button, or hit
  ctrl-F)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>"Clone" projects and "Save As.." files (i.e. replicate
  them)&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Increased file import size limit (was causing things to fail
  to&nbsp;import)
  </li>
  <li>A few other fixes to make things run more smoothly&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Hope you enjoy it :) Any feedback welcome...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Have fun!&nbsp;<br>
