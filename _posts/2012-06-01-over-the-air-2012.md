  Chris and I have come down to Bletchley Park for this years
  annual <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/" rel="nofollow">OTA
  Hackers Event</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Developers have come together to talk all things mobile, attend
  sessions, and bash out pieces of code in the all night hackathon.

  We've come here to tell everyone about the libraries that we've
  been developing for the VF USB 3G dongle, and pick up some keen
  developers for beta testing.
</p>
<p>
  We had a good turn out of interested developers for the first
  session of the day. Chris was totally at home preaching mbed to
  the masses.
