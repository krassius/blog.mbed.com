<p>
  Some of you may have noticed that a site update was pushed out to
  the mbed servers last night, which we're calling
  <strong>mbed</strong> <strong>1.2</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Over the next couple of blog posts, I'm going to take a closer
  look at some the new features and perhaps some of our ideas for
  the future.
</p>
<p>
  In this post, I'll tell you a bit about notebooks.
</p>
<h2>
  Notebooks
</h2>
<p>
  We've given you all a notebook. A notebook is simply a place to
  make notes. Each page of notes can be&nbsp;anything from a quick
  reminder of a pinout to a detailed how-to on a subject complete
  with illustrations.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why notebooks?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We created notebooks to allow mbed developers to share
  information. You can search inside other people's notebooks and
  link to notebooks. You can tag and describe your notebook pages
  to aid in searching.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How do I use my notebook?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A Notebook is made up of <em>pages</em>. Adding a notebook page
  is easy.
</p>

  "border: 1px solid black; vertical-align: middle;" width="848">
</p>
<p>
  Go to your new <em>My Home</em> (more on that later) and then the
  Notebook. Clicking <em>Add new notebook page</em> will open a
  pane where you can make a start on your page.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How do I tell people about my notebook pages?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  We have added a couple of new buttons to the standard editor
  window used in posts. On the far right hand side of the editor
  toolbar, you'll see buttons for inserting a link to
  your&nbsp;Published Programs&nbsp;and Notebook Pages. I'll
  explain some suggested work-flows for making the most of these
  buttons in a later post.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Can I get feedback on notebook pages?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Each notebook page has space for comments and discussion below
  it. If someone leaves a comment on one of your pages, you'll get
  an email letting you know.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Can notebook pages be private?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  All notebook pages are public. However, you do have the option of
  setting a notebook page to be <em>Unlisted</em><strong>.</strong>
  Unlisted pages don't show up in your user activity feed (more on
  that later!) and don't show up in search results. They also won't
  appear in the list of your notebook pages when someone visits
  your Home&nbsp;area.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that even if your page is marked as unlisted,
  <strong>anyone</strong> can still view it if they know the URL.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><br></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What about the cookbook?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  What about the cookbook, you may ask. The cookbook has served us
  well up till now, but a single "flat" wiki would become
  increasingly difficult to manage as our small mbed community
  grew. Plus, there are technical issues involved which make the
  cookbook non-optimal.
</p>
<p>
  The cookbook isn't going away just yet! Notebooks are missing a
  key feature - that being the ability to create group pages to
  allow collaboration on building an information reference.
</p>
<p>
  So, use notebooks if you can, and we'll be working on ways to
  integrate more of the cookbook features. When the cookbook
  replacement is ready, cookbook pages will be copied into any new
  group documentation feature. So you&nbsp;can continue using the
  Cookbook with confidence, and we'll be engaging the mbed
  community in designing the eventual replacement.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>That's it for this quick introduction to
  Notebooks.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  As ever, the Notebooks feature will evolve and improve over time
  in response to user feedback. We already have some early feedback
  which may be the subject of a small further update to come soon.
</p>
<p>
  My next blog post will talk about <em>User Activity</em> and your
  <em>Home</em> area.
