  A few weeks ago, Ariel Lutenberg and his hard working
  collaborative put on an impressive event in Buenos Aires that
  attracted over 500 eager embedded engineers to learn about,
  discuss and develop with embedded systems; not bad for a first
  attempt!
</p>
<p>
  The agenda included an excellent mbed workshop, involving
  programming mbed-based line following robots as part of an
  introduction to working with microcontrollers; you'll have to
  wait until part 2 where we'll have some details (and videos!)
  from Lucas and Joaquin, the workshop organisers.
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations to Ariel and everyone involved for pulling off
  such a successful event! Let's hope this leads to SASE2011.
</p>
<p>
  So in our first guest blog, here is Ariel with a great writeup of
  SASE2010:

  <strong>Argentinean Symposium on Embedded Systems (SASE); a link
  between industry and academy</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Between March 3th-5th of 2010, the Argentinean Symposium on
  Embedded Systems (SASE 2010,&nbsp;<a href=
  "http://www.sase.com.ar">http://www.sase.com.ar</a>) was held at
  the University of Buenos Aires. The event was sponsored by 32
  universities, 10 agencies and institutions, and 13 companies
  (including ARM Ltd. and NXP Semiconductors Inc.). About 500
  people from Argentina and other countries participated in the
  several activities that were organized: 35 tutorials, 6 plenary
  sessions, 5 workshops, a student project’s contest and a prize
  for new products proposals.
</p>
<p>
  The tutorials covered several areas, ranging from
  “Microcontroller architectures and technologies” to FPGA basics
  and advanced applications, and including software oriented topics
  like “Embedded internet” or “Linux for embedded systems”, and
  interface technologies, such as USB, I2C, CAN and JTAG. There
  were also tutorials about hardware related topics, like “Li-Ion
  and Li-Polymer batteries technologies” and “How to design
  electronics for high quantities manufacturing”, and also more
  introductory level tutorials, like “Programming microcontrollers
  in C Language”. These wide offer attracted people from academia
  and industry, thus achieving one of &nbsp;SASE objectives that
  was to bring close this two sectors.
</p>
<p>
  Another objective of the event was to promote the interest of
  young professionals and engineering students on embedded systems,
  and that was successfully achieve by means of two different
  activities.
</p>
<p>
  1) The “mbed workshop”, that was oriented to people whose
  previous experience was only about programming 8 bit
  microcontrollers in Assembly language and the usage of C language
  for computer programs, and who after the nine hours workshop were
  not only able to program the 32-bit Cortex-M3 microcontroller of
  the mbed rapid prototyping kit in C language, but also used this
  platform to program the control algorithm of a line follower car
  that was provided to the participants and use these cars to
  participate in a race that was organized between more than 30
  cars!

</p>
<p>
  2) A student project’s contest, where thirteen high level design
  were presented, including an FPGA simulator for Nuclear plant
  processes, a Low power access method for IEEE 802.15.4, different
  FPGA softcores implementations, an adaptive audio equalizer, and
  several automotive robots.

<p>
  Also, a goal of &nbsp;SASE was to spread the more recent advances
  and trends on embedded system technologies, and it was achieve by
  means of world class tutorials such as “Implementing Cortex A-8
  technology in a FPGA”, by Steve Ravet from ARM, or “Twenty years
  of experience in designing complex embedded systems”, by Erio
  Schweickardt from INVAP, who covered the company experience in
  designing satellites, nuclear plants and radars.

  The key note was the plenary session that closed the event, which
  was presented by Ramon Alonso, an eighty years old Argentinean
  that during the ’60s was assistant director of the MIT
  instrumentation lab team that designed for NASA the Apollo
  Guidance Computer, the heart of the Apollo series of spacecrafts,
  the missions that first took the man to the moon. Ramon presented
  an informal lecture where talked about the Apollo program and
  chat with the audience about the extremely interesting experience
  he got during those days, were the first modern computer was
  designed, using for the first time integrated circuits, and
  revolutionary solutions, as the introduction of the first ROM
  program, which was implemented using a ferromagnetic rope style
  memory.

<p>
  For SASE 2011, we expect to offer even more tutorials and
  workshops, receive the sponsorship for even more companies,
  universities and institutions, and to account with more than 700
  attendees from all Latin America, and hopefully from other
  continents, too.
</p>
<p>
  Looking forward to see you all at SASE 2011,
</p>
<p>
  Best regards,

  Ariel Lutenberg.
