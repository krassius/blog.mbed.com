<p>
  Some compiler updates for you for your programming
  pleasure...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The compiler now has a first cut of support for Google Chrome
  on&nbsp;Windows, and Safari on Mac OS X. Whilst there are still a
  few rough&nbsp;edges, I hope you'll have fun with your new
  freedom! As always, please&nbsp;shout if you spot any
  problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We've also implemented a basic retry mechanism in the compiler,
  with&nbsp;the aim of coping with any internet glitches. If
  something does go&nbsp;wrong on a communication, you should be
  given the option to "retry",&nbsp;and everything should spring
  back in to life. We've made it&nbsp;intentionally invasive at the
  moment so it is obvious a retry has&nbsp;occurred; please report
  if this happens (as with any bugs), as well as&nbsp;whether you
  were able to continue as normal after retrying.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Have Fun!&nbsp;<br>
  Simon
