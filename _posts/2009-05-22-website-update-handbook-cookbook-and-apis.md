  Whilst we've introduced most of these updates in stages over the
  last few weeks, I thought it'd be worth making them
  official!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The basics of the Handbook are in place now at
  http://mbed.co.uk/handbook.&nbsp;This is going to be the main
  guide for the introductions and core mbed&nbsp;apis/features.
  Hopefully the introductions are good to get people&nbsp;started,
  and we'll be concentrating on where you go next;
  any&nbsp;suggestions for what you'd like to see welcome!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We moved over to a "Cookbook" area which is open for anyone to
  add to.&nbsp;It has a wiki and code repository, and we'd
  encourage people to share&nbsp;projects and notes, especially the
  process you go through making them.&nbsp;We've noticed the
  blog-like style works well as not only does it show&nbsp;the
  answer, but also how you got there. This seems a great way to
  help&nbsp;others learn, get suggestions, etc. Go nuts!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We've also implemented auto-documentation for our libraries
  (using the&nbsp;very elegant NaturalDocs). Still some integration
  improvements that&nbsp;haven't quite made it in yet, but getting
  it in there means we can&nbsp;start worrying about improving the
  documentation. And we thought it&nbsp;might be useful to others
  too, so it is also available in the&nbsp;Cookbook. Any code
  checked in to the cookbook repository gets&nbsp;documentation
  generated from it if present, so feel free to
  experiment&nbsp;yourself with your own code.&nbsp;
