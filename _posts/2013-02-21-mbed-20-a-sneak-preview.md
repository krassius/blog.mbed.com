<p>
  Next week at Embedded World, we will be officially announcing
  "mbed 2.0". We'll be posting and announcing more next week, but
  one aspect is <a href="http://mbed.org">http://mbed.org</a> has
  had a bit of a face lift; things like bringing the new QnA to the
  front, improved search and generally nicer layout.
</p>
<p>
  The new site is now in public beta, so feel free to login and
  take a look, and of course, help us spot bugs!
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Some nice things we'll highlight:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>We've mapped out what we believe is the journey a typical
  mbed user makes; exploring the platform and its capabilities,
  buying and mbed development board and getting started,
  prototyping a new design or product, and finally transferring
  that product into manufacturing.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The compiler has had some extensive work around library
  importing, and there there is now documentation within the
  compiler itself
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There has also been a significant amount of work on the content
  pages of the site, bringing them into closer alignment with what
  out users need and expect from the mbed platform, and make
  prototyping with the mbed platform even more productive.
</p>
<p>
  The main announcements are still to come, along with the public
  release of the new site. Have a look around while you wait, let
  us know what you think!
