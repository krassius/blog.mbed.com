  I mentioned in the earlier post about ESC that we had an idea for
  a demo. Well today Chris had a go putting together the hardware
  part...

  This is the mbed commanding some AX-12+ Intelligent Servo motors
  that are digitally controlled, bolted on to the Etch-A-Sketch
  knobs! You can just about make out it is successfully drawing a
  square.
</p>
<p>
  But we obviously have slightly grander plans, so we'll be trying
  to extend its functionality tomorrow.&nbsp;We'll update you on
  progress by the end of the day.
</p>
<p>
  And by then it'll be finished! I know that because we only have
  tomorrow before I fly out :)
