  <a href="http://mbed.org/users/sravet/">Steve</a> just told us
  that Design News and MAKE have announced a "Gadget Freak Design
  Contest!", with a $1000 grand prize...
</p>
<p>
  The contest is for designing and submitting instructions to build
  a gadget which must "incorporate electronic elements" and
  "involve sensing, motion, timing and/or networking
  elements".&nbsp;Sounds like some mbed projects could fit right in
  here!
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't seen Gadget Freak before, here is the sort of
  thing that has made it in to the Gadget Freak archives:

  You may recognise the guy on the right :) That is Steve with his
  Billy Bass, the prequel to our Twittering Billy Bass that we made
  at the end of last year for our launch demo.
</p>
<p>
  For those who haven't seen it yet, check out the result of
  Steve's Billy Bass hack:

  The grand prize for the MAKE Gadget Freak is $1000 plus you might
  get your design on MAKEâ€™s online marketplace. Definitely worth a
  look if you are working on something that could be entered, or
  might have some ideas.
