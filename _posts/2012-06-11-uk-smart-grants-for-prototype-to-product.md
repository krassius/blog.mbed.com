  Ashley Evans of the Electronic Technology networks has contacted
  us to tell us about SMART Grants, and how they might be
  applicable for UK-based mbed developers. SMART Grants are an
  EU-funded initiative aimed at supporting <a href=

  rel="nofollow">SMEs</a> take innovative new designs from the
  drawing board to commercial success.

<p>
  Electronics Technology Network are interested in hearing from
  mbed users who are prototyping proof concepts to be part of a
  case study to understand how SMART grants can assist in
  successful delivery of a marketable product.
</p>
<p>
  The grants fall into three main categories; Market Research,
  Proof of Concept and Prototype development. The ETN are keen for
  applicants to start with the initial Market Research phase. This
  has been shown to really help SMEs clarify the vision of how
  commercial success will be achieved, and applications who
  complete this stage have a much better chance of securing a grant
  in subsequent phases.
</p>
<p>
  Having completed a Market Research phase, an mbed user developing
  a product is most likely to fall into the Proof of Concept
  category. This allows a development cycle of up to 18 months, and
  has a maximum grant of Â£100k, which can make up 60% of total
  project costs.

</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the ETN are working with third parties to help
  advise SMEs about R&amp;D tax credits. Recent changes to the tax
  laws makes it easier to secure tax benefits on innovative R&amp;D
  expenditure.
