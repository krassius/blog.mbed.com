<p>
  On June 17th the ARM University Program will be running a one-day
  Microcontroller Workshop at ARM Headquarters in Cambridge.
</p>
<p>
  These workshops are exclusively for teaching faculty and
  post-graduate members of academia, and will provide the knowledge
  needed to teach students to use these tools in Labs and Projects.
</p>
<p>
  The objective of this workshop is simple: “train the trainer”, so
  you are able to share this knowledge with your students.

<h3>
  ARM University Program
</h3>
<p>
  The aim of the ARM University Program is to encourage the use of
  ARM processors as the basis for educational labs and university
  courses. University courses, student projects, and research which
  focus on SoC design, computer architecture, embedded systems,
  microprocessors/controllers, assembly programming, OS application
  development, robotics, or mechatronics can benefit from using ARM
  IP and development systems. The program provides a variety of
  teaching materials, development tools, and other resources for
  both faculty and students.
