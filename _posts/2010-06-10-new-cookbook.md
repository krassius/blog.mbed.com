<p>
  We've just put live the new mbed Cookbook, a fully-integrated
  wiki that provides a community repository for building blocks and
  tutorials to help get prototypes up and running even faster. Here
  are the details...
</p>

</h2>
<p>
  The cookbook is the place for community contributed reusable
  building blocks, reference and tutorials.&nbsp;Think of it as the
  community Handbook; anything that can be reused or referenced to
  help someone cook up their project.
</p>
<p>
  For example, it's the place to document a library, pinout, and
  code examples for a useful component that others can use. Or a
  reference of how to hook up an mbed to your favourite web api or
  programming language.
</p>
<p>
  The cookbook is a wiki, editable by any user. It is fully
  integrated into the rest of the mbed site, so all the content is
  searchable and taggable. You can also comment on wiki pages to
  discuss the content.
</p>
<h2>
  <strong>Contributing to the cookbook</strong>
</h2>
<p>
  All users are very welcome to dive in and start editing and
  creating pages in the new cookbook. Don't worry if you're not
  sure how to lay something out, just have a go and it can be
  refined over time.
</p>
<p>
  As a guide, the aim is to be a definitive guide to lots of
  components. That means a page is likely to be about the
  component, not what you are doing with it (e.g. how to get
  component x working rather than here is a project that uses w, x,
  y to do z). For projects you are working on and the development
  of libraries, the notebooks are still the place to journal your
  progress. Hopefully, many useful cookbook pages can be extracted
  from the findings of these notebook projects.
</p>
<p>
  So if you've worked out how to get a widget or gizmo connected to
  mbed, have a go at writing it up and see if it helps anyone else.
</p>
<h2>
  <strong>Future plans</strong>
</h2>
<p>
  As early adopters will remember, we put up the original cookbook
  a while back as a test, and it was incredibly successful. But it
  wasn't very integrated in to the site (search, editing, etc) and
  quickly showed signs of scaling badly as people were using it for
  documenting everything and anything, and that meant varying
  quality too.
</p>
<p>
  So that is when we decided to introduce the Notebook concept, to
  provide a place for project notes. That has also had a great
  pickup, so we're really happy with this newer model; Notebooks
  for user projects and personal logs, the Cookbook for more
  reusable building blocks.
</p>
<p>
  The cookbook and the wiki engine we now have in place means not
  only can we open up this community repository once again in a
  much more integrated and searchable way, but we also plan to move
  over to the wiki markup as the default way of creating content
  throughout the rest of the site, including the forum. We'll also
  use it internally for the handbook, so that becomes properly
  searchable too. There's a lot of other exciting features that now
  become possible thanks to the new wiki system - so watch this
  space!
</p>
<p>
  So now go dive in, and share your hard work that others could
  make use of: <a href=

</p>
<p>
  Have fun!
