<p>
  To enter the competition just pick up your preferred STM32 based
  development board and add at least one other ST component then
  send a description and video of your innovative application
  (<a href=
  "http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/corporate/company/policy_statement/Terms_Conditions_ST_Contest%202014.pdf"
  rel="nofollow">full T&amp;Cs can be found here</a>). Should you
  be one of the 3 lucky winners you will receive an invite to the
  award ceremony during Electronica in Munich – November 11th –
  14th 2014.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to get something up and running quickly, easily
  and with a whole community backing you why not choose one of the
  many ARM® mbed®-enabled development boards: the ST Nucleo boards
  based on STM32, available for only $10. The mbed.org website
  lists 5 different boards that are instantly available (<a href=
  "https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F103RB/">F103RB</a>,
  <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F302R8/">F302R8</a>,
  <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L152RE/">L512RE</a>,
  <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F401RE/">F401RE</a>,
  <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F030R8/">F030R8</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Not a bad return on investment; a cutting edge smart phone and
  watch worth $1,200 for a $10 development board and a bit of fun
  engineering. Alternatively, if you register your idea through the
  Facebook page before 31st July ST are providing FREE Nucelo
  boards and Wurth Elektronik are giving away free passive
  components for the project.
</p>
<p>
  Good Luck!
</p>
<p>
  Note, the Galaxy Note and Polar V800 replace the previously
  announced Hyetis smart watch.
