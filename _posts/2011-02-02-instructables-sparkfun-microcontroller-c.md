  Instructables and Sparkfun are running a competition for
  microcontroller projects. Here is the project that brought it to
  my attention, and how you can get involved...

<p>
  <a href="http://mbed.org/users/jimk3038/">James Kemp</a> has
  posted an instructable showing how you can get automotive
  ultrasonic sensors used for parking detectors up and running with
  mbed:

<p>
  You can see the full walkthrough here:

  </li>
</ul>

  But while I was looking at that, I noticed a banner advertising a
  competition:

<p>
  Here is the blurb:
</p>
<p>
  "To enter the contest, make a new Instructable that involves a
  microcontroller, any microcontroller, and be sure to share the
  code you used. The Instructable can cover getting started or show
  how to make some epic project. It's up to you!"
</p>
<p>
  The competition ends on February 13th, so you only have just
  under two weeks!
</p>
<p>
  To see how you could submit something, take a look at:

  Good luck!
