<h3>
  This is part two of the series of posts about site update 1.2.
</h3>
<p>
  To continue our aim of improving the community features of mbed,
  we have added several new features and improved some existing
  ones.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>User homepages</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Previously every user
  had a very basic home area. Hopefully now your home page does a
  better job of bringing together everything a user is up to. The
  mechanisms for updating settings and your profile have been
  updated, too.</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>User profiles</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You can now upload a profile picture and write a description
  about yourself where you can link to your blog, etc.. To edit
  your profile, just go to the <strong>My Home</strong> link in the
  main menu, and then click <strong>Edit profile</strong> at the
  top right.

  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <strong>User activity feed</strong>
</p>
<p>
  There is now a feed of (almost) all activity on mbed. Each user
  gets their own feed, and there is also one for everyone put
  together. An RSS feed of each person's feed and the aggregated
  feed for everyone is in the works and should be a part of the
  upcoming 1.2.1 release.
</p>
