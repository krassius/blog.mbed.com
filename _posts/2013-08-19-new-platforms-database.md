<p>
  We've now put live another new feature hot on the heels of the
  Component Database - the mbed-enabled Platforms Database!
</p>

</p>
<p>
  We developed this to allow us to support all the mbed-enabled
  boards that are popping up since we opened up the SDK and HDK for
  use on 3rd party platforms. You can select any of these boards to
  use in the compiler for free!
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the new platforms we support already:

<ul>
  <li>See <a href="/platforms">/platforms</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  ...look out for more appearing soon!
</p>
<p>
  The platforms database currently just contains development
  boards, but is designed to work with development boards, OEM
  modules or final hackable products - so it can even be used to
  reprogram finished end devices.
</p>
<p>
  If you are designing a development board, OEM module or final
  product, you should consider making it mbed-enabled and take
  advantage of the mbed tools and ecosystem for free and allow it
  to connect to all ARM toolchains - email us at <a href=
  "mailto:support@mbed.org">support@mbed.org</a> for more
  information!
