  If anyone was watching sky channel 880 last night at around
  10.15, you'd have seen Chris in his garage with a big wooden box
  and an mbed.
</p>
<p>
  But why? Well, a team from "Teachers TV" asked to come to film
  him doing some of his&nbsp;activities&nbsp;as a "STEM
  Ambassador"; someone who goes out and helps with Science,
  Technology, Engineering, Maths in schools.&nbsp;The result is a
  15 min video which shows some experiments going on during a visit
  to a local school.

  It should be no surprise that it was based around using mbed, but
  it was a great reminder of what triggered mbed in the first
  place. It was many moons ago that we were trying to do the same
  thing in the schools with "traditional" kit, and getting very
  frustrated&nbsp;(as were the kids); it got in the way of their
  ideas. It was the classic scratch your own itch scenario, with us
  thinking "it could be so much better!".
</p>
<p>
  Interestingly, the best decision I think we ever made in tackling
  this problem was <strong>not</strong> to go and build something
  specifically for taught education. We decided to try and make
  something that solved the problems we were seeing, but where it
  was a generic problem that was applicable to anyone trying to
  prototype something. The position we took was particularly
  inspired by the books <a href=
  "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Deschooling-Society-Open-Forum-Illich/dp/0714508799">
  "Deschooling Society" (Ivan Illich, 1971)</a> which was a great
  reminder that people should always be learning (i.e. not just in
  taught environments), and <a href=
  "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1258456584&amp;sr=1-1">
  "The Paradox of Choice" (Barry Schwartz, 2004)</a>, explaining
  how a lot of complexity can be attributed to choice
  paralysis/overload. My own interpretation of this is that it is
  common to pass on decisions to users in the form of "options",
  where infact you are actually passing on complexity and hard
  decisions. Finally, we wanted to ensure we could make it
  commercially viable so it could support continuous investment in
  itself.

  As and example of how these school visits impacted our thinking,
  I can remember one day going in to a school and seeing their
  electronics lesson (I wish I had a photo!); they were soldering
  leaded components to copper tape stuck on to cardboard. I
  couldn't even do that; you need three hands! Worse still, as you
  apply the heat, the glue on the copper tape melts and peels of
  the card! I'm sure there were good reasons, but at some level you
  have to ask yourself why industry doesn't do it like that?!
</p>
<p>
  It was things like this that focused us on wanting to make
  industry-style tools more accessible; using C/C++ rather than
  dreaming up some graphical flowchart programming to "make it
  easy", or using 0.1" pitch rather than a simple (but ultimately
  restrictive) "modular system".

  The great thing about this video was it reminded us we'd been
  able to come full circle, and apply mbed back to what originally
  inspired us. What started as a little skunk-works project is now
  a real product, and we're hoping to continually improve on it to
  help more people experiment with microcontrollers. Whilst taught
  education is certainly not our primary focus, we hope mbed will
  find a home with some people who want to apply it to let students
  explore these sorts of things.

  And don't worry if you missed it! It is now published on <a href=
  "http://www.teachers.tv/video/38108">Teachers TV</a>, so go check
  it out! You even get to see the mbed HQ white board in the
  background at one point :)
