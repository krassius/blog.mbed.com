  For the past week we have been at Embedded World showcasing some
  great demos using mbed on the ARM stand. We had two main themes
  at this years show for mbed - <strong>Connecting MCUs to the
  Cloud</strong> and the new <strong><a href=
  "/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC11U24">mbed NXP LPC11U24
  Microcontroller</a></strong> .<br>
  <br>

</p>
<p>
  We used our <a href="/cookbook/IOT">IoT application</a> to
  demonstrate sending real-time sensor data over the internet using
  HTML5 websockets using multiple network transports. <a href=
  "/cookbook/Internet-of-things-using-Ethernet">Ethernet</a>,
  <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/cookbook/Internet-of-things-using-Wifi">Wi-Fi</a>
  and even previewed a sensor connected using 3G Mobile Internet -
  which we'll have more details to follow soon!<br>
</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>
  We had some good interest in the <a href="/handbook/USBMouse">USB
  Mouse</a>, <a href="/handbook/USBKeyboard">USB Keyboard</a>, and
  <a href="/handbook/USBHID">USB HID</a> demos we did for the
  LPC11U24 mbed. A lot of people were impressed at the ease of
  prototyping USB devices. We're hoping to see a lot more awesome
  USB device applications developed using mbed!<br>
  <br>

</p>
<p>
  NXP had the <a href="/cookbook/Slingshot"><strong>USB
  Slingshot</strong></a> that we developed on their stand as part
  of their promotion of the LPC11Uxx MCU family. Lots of feedback
  about how amazing everyone thought the concept was. At times they
  had some pretty big crowds around their stand of people wanting
  to give it a go.
</p>

  </p>
<p>
  We also developed an NFC demo for NXP using one of their new
  evaluation kits. Smart payment is making <strong>NFC
  technology</strong> quite popular at the moment - but we wanted
  to show another application for it. We came up with a clever
  <a href="/cookbook/NFCLamp">NFCLamp</a> that could have it's
  colour modified using an NFC-enabled Android - a contact-less
  lighting controller.
</p>
<p>
  mbed was also featured on some of our partners stands as well. As
  we mentioned, <strong>RS Components</strong> <a href=
  "/blog/entry/RS-announce-new-mbed-based-Synergy-board/">announced</a>
  the Synergy range of breakout boards for the mbed
  Microcontroller. They previewed the AudioCODEC board and the
  DisplayBoard, which will be available later this year.<br>

  <strong>Farnell</strong> included the mbed in one of their dev
  kit display cabinets as well.<br>

  We're all a bit exhausted after standing for almost 3 days
  straight, but it was well worth it. Thanks to Nuremberg for
  hosting us, we managed to drop by some pretty cool places for a
  few quiet drinks in the evenings as well.
</p>
<p>
  So it was a pretty good show for us - lots of positive feedback
  from a lot of visitors. Thanks to the mbed users that came over
  to say hi as well - it was great to meet you!
