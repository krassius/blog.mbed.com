<p>
  We are happy to announce that the Pull Requests feature is now in
  open beta. This also marks an important milestone – the <a href=
  "/handbook/mbed-Tools">mbed Online Tools</a> is now offering a
  complete set of collaboration development models – the <a href=
  "/handbook/Collaboration/Multiple-authors">multiple authors</a>
  (a.k.a. shared repository) model and the fork &amp; pull model,
  where pull requests play major role as median between independent
  developers and repository authors.

<h3>
  But what is a pull request?
</h3>
<p>
  A pull request lets you tell others about changes you've added to
  a fork of their (or ancestor) repository, effectively granting
  them permission to include and use your code in their code base.
  Once the pull request is created, the other party can review,
  accept or reject the set of changes, discuss further
  modifications and even add follow-up changes or merges.
</p>
<p>
  Think of pull requests as for simplified <a href=
  "/handbook/Collaboration/Getting-started#forking-a-repository">fork
  and update</a> workflow, where the changes contributed by
  non-repository developers are being moderated by the repository
  author(s).
</p>
<p>
  Most online services that offer source code and version control
  hosting let you review and merge pull requests.<br>
  We made a step further by letting you review, compile, test and
  add more changes if necessary before accepting a pull request by
  harnessing the power of the <a href=
  "/handbook/mbed-Compiler">mbed Online Compiler</a>.

<ul>
  <li>Repository <a href=

    comparison mode</a> that lets you compare a workspace
    repository with related published repository without
    permanently changing the URL.
  </li>
  <li>Code highlighter improvements and correct line numbering for
  diff code examples in wiki pages, forums etc.
  </li>
  <li>Redesigned repository home pages to accommodate more
  repository actions.
  </li>
  <li>Improved IDE initialization and rendering.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Trying out the beta
</h3>
<p>
  Before you try out the beta, please be aware that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You will be using a beta, which even though we consider
  stable and safe, have not been tested in larger scale. It is
  advised to use copies of workspace and published code.
  </li>
  <li>Pull requests will be visible only in beta until the official
  release, though pull requests that you accept will immediately
  cause the accepted changes to be published to the live
  repository.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To try out the beta, visit <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/betamode/">http://mbed.org/betamode/</a> and
  click "Enable betamode".
