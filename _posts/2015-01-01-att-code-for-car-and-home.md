  There was a great turnout and pure excitement about mbed at the
  <a href=
  "https://mbed.org/blog/entry/FRDM-KL46Z-Launched-at-ATT-Developers-/">
  AT&amp;T Developer Summit 2014 Hackathon in January</a>, so we
  decided to attend again. This time is the <a href=
  "http://attcarhomehackathon.com/" rel="nofollow">AT&amp;T
  Hackathon @ Super Mobility Week – Code for Car &amp; Home</a> in
  Las Vegas, September 6-7, 2014. We have teamed up with <a href=
  "http://freescale.com/" rel="nofollow">Freescale
  Semiconductor</a>, <a href="http://multitech.com" rel=
  "nofollow">Multi-Tech Systems</a>, <a href=
  "http://www.nordicsemi.com/" rel="nofollow">Nordic
  Semiconductor</a>, <a href="http://st.com/" rel="nofollow">ST
  Microelectronics</a> and <a href="www.ublox.com/">u-blox</a> to
  form <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/teams/ATT-CTIA-Hackathon-2014/">‘Team mbed</a>.’
  Team mbed brings a variety of hardware platforms for developers
  to choose from based on I/O and connectivity needs (Bluetooth®,
  cellular, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi®). Not to mention the 35+ sensors
  and actuators that we'll be bringing.

  <strong>Last but certainly not least</strong>, I came across this
  blog by Quinton Wall that has some great pointers for <a href=
  "https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/07/deliver-winning-pitch-hackathons.html"
  rel="nofollow">‘How to deliver a winning pitch at hackathons’</a>
  it is a must read for all those attending! Here are the
  highlights:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Assign a speaker, and a demo driver</strong><br>
    Since pitches are typically short, assign only one speaker and
    a demo driver.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Restate your vision and business
    opportunity</strong><br>
    Structure your pitch. State your vision, why your approach is
    unique and what business opportunity is.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do not call out challenges or problems</strong><br>
    Let the judges ask about the challenges, there is no need to
    point them out.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Keep slides to a minimum</strong><br>
    Use slides to enhance your pitch, whether it’s to tell a story,
    add humor or describe your design…keep it short and memorable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Maximum demo stage time</strong><br>
    The speaker and demo persons should practice together. Ensure
    that the narrative and demo align and it is clear to the
    audience what makes your design unique.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Q&amp;A is part of your pitch</strong><br>
    Prepare some responses to potential questions prior to your
    pitch. Here is Quinton’s list of common questions at
    Hackathons:
    <ol>
      <li>What were the challenges you faced?
      </li>
      <li>If you had more time, what would you focus on?
      </li>
      <li>What’s the business value / opportunity of this app?
      </li>
      <li>What is your plan for the app/idea post hackathon?
      </li>
      <li>What was the inspiration of the idea?
      </li>
      <li>Who are your target users?
      </li>
      <li>App abc is very similar. What makes yours unique?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
