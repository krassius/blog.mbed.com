  Inspired by a request at ESC, here is a 60 second introduction to
  the mbed Compiler...

  Hopefully this gives a good feel of what it is about for anyone
  who hasn't got their hands on an mbed yet.

  And it means I've now got some screen video capture software, so
  hopefully we can use it for a few tutorials too :)
