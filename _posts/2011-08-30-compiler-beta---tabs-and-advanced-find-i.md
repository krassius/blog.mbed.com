<p>
  We've put up a couple of new features on the beta site for anyone
  interested in some early access testing:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Editor Tabs - for switching between open files you are
  editing
  </li>
  <li>Advanced Find - to search across all files within your
  project
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Editor Tabs
</h2>

</p>
<p>
  The file editor now supports tabs, making it simple to switch
  between files you are currently editing. Hopefully pretty self
  explanatory.
</p>
<h2>
  Advanced Find
</h2>
<p>
  The find functionality has now been extended, so you can search
  beyond the current file.

</p>
<p>
  Having enabled the Find bar (Toolbar icon, or Ctrl-F), there is
  now an "Advanced" button. Hit that and you'll get the Advanced
  Find in Files window:

  "/media/uploads/simon/beta-find02.png">
</p>
<p>
  This enables you to search across multiple files and filetypes;
  for example, across your whole program. When you search, the
  reuslts will appear as a list in the compiler output window where
  you can jump to any of them with a click:

</p>
<p>
  To try it out, just enable <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/betamode/">http://mbed.org/betamode/</a>. I'm
  sure there are still a few bugs to iron out, so please fire any
  reports at the forum as per normal.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully some useful features to enhance your coding pleasure...
