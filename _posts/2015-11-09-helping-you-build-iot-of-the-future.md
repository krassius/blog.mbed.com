  <i><b>“We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing
  new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us
  down new paths.” —Walt Disney</b></i><br>
</p>
<p>
  Cloud computing is changing the world, offering businesses and
  developers alike ways to leverage data in an agile,
  cost-effective way as IoT deployments reach scale. We have seen
  our huge developer community take IoT deployments, based on mbed
  products, into applications that are transforming industries –
  both technology-led and traditionally non-technology industries
  such as smart construction. I have been talking to mbed partners
  about ‘why IoT is for them’ for years, but there is an exciting
  shift in these conversations as the benefits of IoT linked with
  big data are becoming undeniable. These conversations,
  everywhere, have turned to ‘how can we leverage IoT at scale’.
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The ‘how’ question comes down to -
</p>
<ol>
  <li>How can I manage the complexity that arises from connecting a
  wide range of devices that feature different technologies and
  ensure that they continue to deliver value well into the future?
  </li>
  <li>How can I leverage the industry leading ecosystem around the
  breadth of ARM Cortex-M processor based solutions and use this to
  deploy IoT applications quickly, and have them integrate into
  cloud services helping solve business needs right now?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In September this year, we focused on three key areas: <a href=
  "http://blog.mbed.com/post/130148704027/cloud-integration-gets-simpler">
  extending the cloud services</a> and ecosystem choice available
  to developers, creating developer tools to help you improve
  productivity and reducing the time to market so that businesses
  can take advantage of IoT quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Leading cloud partners have centralized their technologies around
  the mbed IoT Device Platform with the likes of <a href=
  "http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/ibm-arm-iot-adoption-security,1-2881.html">
  IBM Bluemix</a>, <a href=

  Zebra Technologies</a> joining the mbed ecosystem. We are also
  excited that the momentum of the mbed ecosystem continues to
  extend the choice of silicon, tools, applications and support
  continues to grow. Since May 2015, we have welcomed <b>24 new
  partners</b> including: 1248, Alcatel-Lucent, Analog Devices,
  Baidu, Captiva, Delta, Express Logic, ForgeRock, GreenPeak,
  Nuvoton, ON Semiconductor, PixArt, Renesas, Schneider-Electric,
  Silver Spring Networks, SK Telecom, Smeshlink, SpinDance, Switch

  Today, just ahead of our <a href="http://www.armtechcon.com/">ARM
  Tech Con 2015 conference</a> in Santa Clara, Nov
  10-12<sup>th</sup>, we are releasing mbed Device Connector, a new
  service for developers to connect and manage up to 100 devices
  and handling up to 10,000 events an hour for free. This is
  available to you on <a href=
  "https://connector.mbed.com/">connector.mbed.com</a>. This
  console will help you get started in minutes, access example code
  for applications and connect to your choice of cloud partners
  quickly. mbed Device Connector is a first step and you can find
  details of <a href=
  "http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/arm-unveils-enhanced-technologies-to-speed-up-mass-deployment-of-iot-devices.php">
  this release here</a>. You’ve helped us shape this particularly
  through the event transactions we have seen you relay are
  important to your projects to scale. You can get started today
  and when you are ready to move to more than 100 devices, all the
  development done on this free version is ready to <a href=
  "https://www.mbed.com/en/development/cloud/mbed-device-connector-service">
  move to commercial scale</a> through our ecosystem.

  What’s new in mbed OS Technology Preview
</h2>
<p>
  When we announced the mbed OS beta version, you would have
  noticed that this was a <a href=
  "https://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-os/">combination</a>
  of OS and developer tools. Together, they focus on offering the
  building blocks for IoT build on inter-operable standards, ready
  for next generation connectivity and with strong foundations of
  security. mbed OS is a new operating system built with the strong
  security, connectivity and manageability for large-scale IoT
  deployments in mind.

  Today, we’ve released the <a href=
  "https://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-os/releases/">first
  public mbed OS Technology Preview</a> version and associated
  tools, to offer you early access to some of the exciting features
  that we believe will help you take full advantage of your IoT
  devices.
</p>
<p>
  The mbed OS Technology Preview provides early access to upcoming
  product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and
  provide feedback during the development process. Our focus in
  this release is on laying the foundation for mbed OS development
  and collaboration, particularly core tools, technology and
  testing. If you’re already using <a href=
  "https://developer.mbed.org/">earlier versions</a> of mbed,
  please note that mbed OS is a new operating system; although it
  shares some code with mbed Classic, it has its own structure,
  tools, APIs and philosophy. We expect mbed OS developers to be
  able to access, build and run example projects and to explore the
  underlying code.
</p>
<p>
  <b>mbed OS Technology Preview</b> offers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First native OS support for Thread
  </li>
  <li>First inclusion of BLE
  </li>
  <li>mbed uVisor support for sample ARM Cortex-M4 devices using
  the ARM MPU
  </li>
  <li>Further improvements in test coverage and stability – an
  ongoing endeavor
  </li>
  <li>Stronger defect management, and errata reporting through
  “known issues” documents
  </li>
  <li>yotta target support for mbed Enabled targets from a
  selection of silicon partners &nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>
