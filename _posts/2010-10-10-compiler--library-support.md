<p>
  Yesterday, the beta version of the site went live, which adds
  integrated user created library&nbsp;support, as well as an
  upgrade to the mbed Compiler.
</p>
<p>
  This is really just an update to&nbsp;Simon's <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/blog/entry/Compiler-support-for-user-libraries-now2/">
  earlier post</a>, in which the library support and changes to the
  IDE are fully described.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that all the features (along with many assorted
  bugfixes/improvements) described above have now been released!
</p>
<p>
  In a followup to this blog post we'll hopefully get to have a
  look at some of the libraries that are starting to be created.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this is a major update of the <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-Compiler">mbed Compiler</a>, and
  the first upgrade of the underlying ARM compiler in a long
  time.&nbsp;As such, there may be some user code issues relating
  to the tool upgrade. If you have code which previously compiled
  and is now having issues, please see <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/forum/bugs-suggestions/post/5690/">this</a>
  forum post, which may help you determine if you are affected.
</p>
<p>
  As ever, any and all feedback is welcome!
</p>
<p>
