  So after a good session during the day, it was time to step up to
  the big stage in the Main Marquee.

  Chris presented a more in-depth talk about the Internet of
  Things, 3G Mobile and even included live coding demos. Even with
  dodgy Wi-Fi, the talk went well and had some good questions from
  the audience. Well done Chris!

  Ashley, who we shared the session with, gave a full teardown of
  the SMS printer and a VGA Camera prototype, that captured images
  and posted them online over 3G using HTTP. Excellent applications
  for the 3G Dongle.

  Throughout the day there were a mostly sessions about mobile app
  and web development - so it was awesome to see that people were
  so interested in embedded development as well - especially after
  they saw the online compiler and APIs. We got lots of great
  feedback, and positive comments and mbed.

  So at nightfall, as with any overnight hacking event, the fun
  begins! We had all of our hacking stations setup, and constant
  stream of people interested in building something. Hoping to have
  some impressive mbed prototypes submitted for tomorrows
  competition.
</p>
<p>
  Good luck everyone!
