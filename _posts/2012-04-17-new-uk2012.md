  Come along to see us, if you are at the show.
</p>
<p>
  We'll be showing off the <a href="/cookbook/IOT">Internet of
  Things</a> demo - this is a great demonstration of how to connect
  MCU's to the cloud utilising HTML5 Websocket technology.
</p>
<p>
  It would be great to see you there and find out about any
  projects that you are working on.
