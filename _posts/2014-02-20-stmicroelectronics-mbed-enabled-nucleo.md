  Just today <a href=
  "http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/active/en/press/en/p3526" rel=
  "nofollow">STMicroelectronics (STMicro) announced</a> their new
  line of STM32 mbed-enabled development boards, the STM32 Nucleo!
</p>
<p>
  This will be a full line covering the STM32 Microcontrollers, and
  of course the really great thing is ST developers will now have
  access to mbed’s ecosystem of software, tools, and community!
</p>
<p>
  The Nucleo boards will allow developers to re-use hardware and
  software IP for multiple projects and create scalability for
  their STM32 designs, as they are all going to be the same form
  factor and software platform. This will also offer a wide variety
  of shields supporting functions such as Bluetooth® LE or Wi-Fi
  connectivity, GPS, audio recording utilizing STMicro’s MEMS
  microphone capability, proximity sensing, and wireless control.
</p>
<p>
  This is a great line, and we are looking forward to seeing the
  wider range of prototypes and innovations that come from the
  addition of the STM32 Nucleo family.
</p>
<p>
  And if you are wondering, the first <a href=
  "/platforms/?tvend=10">four boards</a> will be released at
  Embedded World next week at $10.32 per unit!
