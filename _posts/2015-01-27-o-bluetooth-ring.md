  Wearable technology is a hot topic right now and it seems like a
  new smartwatch or fitness tracker is announced every other day!
  But what about having a tiny computer on your finger? What would
  you want it to control? I recently came across one of the
  smallest mbed projects we have ever seen before, the <a href=
  "http://www.arduboy.com/o-bluetooth-ring/" rel="nofollow">Ö
  Bluetooth Ring</a>. This tiny personal computer was created by
  Kevin Bates, the founder of the company <a href=
  "http://www.arduboy.com/o-bluetooth-ring/" rel=
  "nofollow">Arduboy</a>, and we got a chance to chat with him
  while on his business travel in route to Shenzhen, China via
  Hawaii.

  This 3D printed, bluetooth ring features a 64x32 monochrome OLED
  display, and touch button. 4+ hours of battery life with the
  display on and 24+ hours when in standby. It was prototyped using
  the <a href="/platforms/Seeed-Arch-BLE/">Seeed Arch BLE</a>, is
  programmed with mbed and the final design uses the Nordic
  nRF51822 SoC wrapped up in <a href=

    This ring allows you to receive and reply to notifications from
    your cell phone, show fun animations, display digital and
    analog clocks and much more. Bates is currently working on the
    final design and ring assembly. He plans to move to the CSP
    (chip scale package), which will decrease the size of the ring
    making it more comfortable for daily wear. We are looking
    forward to seeing how this project progresses and are eager to
    try it out ourselves.

    If you've taken a project from prototype to production (or are
    in pre-production) we'd love to hear about it. Send a message
    to support@mbed.org and tell us about it!
