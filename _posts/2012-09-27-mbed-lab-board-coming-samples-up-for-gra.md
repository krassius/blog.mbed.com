<p>
  After a busy year at mbed HQ, I've picked up again on an earlier
  plan to make a lab board for the mbed NXP LPC1768. Read more
  about the original concept the blog post entitled <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/blog/entry/On-the-mbed-Whiteboard/">On the mbed
  Whiteboard</a>
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, this is the before and after...
</p>

  We're expecting this to retail at something around $50.

<h2>
  Write a driver, get one free!
</h2>
<p>
  The first samples are currently being manufactured so its time to
  have a little fun. We are offering 3 lab boards free in return
  for writing one of the 3 peripheral driver libraries required.
</p>
<p>
  These are the 3 peripherals need a good cookbook page
</p>
<ul>
  <li>128x32 Graphics LCD, Backlit, SPI Interface, Newhaven C12832
  </li>
  <li>3 Axis Accelerometer, +/- 1.5g, I2C Interface, Freescale
  MMA7660
  </li>
  <li>Temperature sensor, NXP LM75B, I2C Interface
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A good cookbook page includes (among other things) :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Peripheral driver library (Documented with Doxygen, published
  under default MIT License)
  </li>
  <li>Hello world program (written by the user, published under
  default MIT licence)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  An example of a good cookbook page is <a href=
  "/cookbook/Nokia-LCD">Nokia-LCD</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The other features of the board are :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Socket for Xbee (Zigbee) or RN-XV (Wifi)
  </li>
  <li>5 way navigation switch
  </li>
  <li>2 x Potentiometers
  </li>
  <li>2 x 3.5mm Audio jack (Analog In/Out)
  </li>
  <li>2 x Servo motor headers
  </li>
  <li>RGB LED, PWM connected
  </li>
  <li>Speaker, PWM connected
  </li>
  <li>USB-B connector (keyboard, mouse, MIDI)
  </li>
  <li>USB-A connector (Flash drive, Bluetooth, GSM Modem(UK Only))
  </li>
  <li>RJ45 Ethernet connector
  </li>
  <li>1.3mm DC Jack input (Powering USB-A and Servo headers)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  So, if you are interested in getting one of the 3 first lab
  boards, email us at support@mbed.org. Tell us which part you want
  to write a library for, and send link(s) to examples of your work
  that's already published.
</p>
<p>
  Good luck!
