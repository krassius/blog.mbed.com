<p>
  We'll be at <a href="http://www.embedded-world.de/en/" rel=
  "nofollow">Embedded World</a> in Nuremberg over the next few
  days. Here are a few mbed-related things we hope will be spotted
  there...
</p>
<h2>
  Hi-Fi Audio!
</h2>
<p>
  First up is an early preview of some work we're doing with
  <a href="http://www.designspark.com/" rel="nofollow">RS Design
  Spark</a>. This is a hot-off-the-press example PCB for using mbed
  to drive a high quality I2S DAC, so you can get hifi quality
  audio from mbed!
</p>

</p>
<p>
  The I2S DAC is a <a href=
  "http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlv320aic23b.html"
  rel="nofollow">TLV320AIC23B</a>, and includes a built-in
  headphone amplifier, so is a great single-chip solution for
  adding audio.
</p>
<p>
  RS should have this early board on their stand, and it will be
  written up as a series of articles over the next couple of months
  detailing all the software and schematics needed to reproduce it.
  Hopefully this will be great for people wanting to build
  equipment that produces high quality audio through to music
  players and internet streaming radios. It sounds awesome.
</p>
<h2>
  Robot Racing!
</h2>
<p>
  We built some robots last year. We let people program and race
  them. It was a hit!
</p>
<p>
  They'll be on the ARM stand in one form or another for you to
  have a go with:

  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Big Board!
</h2>
<p>
  The mbed approach is about providing you a component rather than
  a "modular" system, so you can wire it up to anything and get
  programming. This big board is designed to show you how we've
  wired up a few components, so you can try out programming with
  mbed for yourself!

<p>
  You should be able to find this on the NXP stand.

<h2>
  Say Hi!
</h2>
<p>
  We'll be around on the expo floor and at some of the demos, so if
  you are visiting, come and say hi! It'd be great to chat and see
  what you are up to.
</p>
<p>
  And as we don't get to see much of the show, if you do see mbed
  anywhere else, drop us a line or post a photo.
