  If you missed <a href="http://mbed.org/users/ms523/">Martin
  Smith's</a> post in the forum about E.R.I.C the robot dog, you
  might just want to take a look at this:

  It is an awesome project, not just because of the finished
  product, but because the wide range of skills showcased. These
  range from embedded software development and debug, to the very
  theoretical/mathematical pursuit of image processing algorithms,
  to the mechanical aspects of the design with the AX-12 servos,
  and of course CAD/CAM design, leading up to milling things out of
  aluminium!

  I'd spoken with Martin before a couple of years ago, so didn't
  feel shy about asking him to do a bit of a write-up. As he'd
  already kept a very detailed on-line notebook (which I spent a
  good deal of time reading through!) all I was really asking for
  was an overview.
</p>
<p>
  As a part of this project Martin has also documented and
  published under the default MIT license a library for the AX-12
  servos used by ERIC. I'd previously make a prototype version of
  this library, so it was nice to see it given the love and
  attention it deserves.
</p>
<p>
  I think congratulations are in order to Martin for pulling off
  such an awesome project, and documenting it so thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
  If anyone else has produced a project of similar quality (either
  as part of their studies, just for fun, or even as a prototype
  design in their job) and would be happy to share it in this sort
  of detail, please drop me a line support@mbed.org.
