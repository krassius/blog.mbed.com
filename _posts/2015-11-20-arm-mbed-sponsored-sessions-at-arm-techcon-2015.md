<h2>
  <b>Making IoT scalable, robust and easy to deploy</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Zach Shelby, vice president of marketing for IoT at ARM,
  presented along side 1248, Freescale and IBM. He led the
  discussion by pointing out that “according to Gartner estimates,
  over 50% of IoT devices and innovations will be deployed by
  startups and our job is to make it easy for the innovators to do
  their thing.” As a part of that, enterprises need confidence in
  investments that the initial deployments can be leveraged and
  brought to scale. With that mbed aims to facilitate the growth of
  the IoT markets by delivering access to a comprehensive IoT
  ecosystem and providing trusted end-to-end security solutions.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  For those that haven’t heard of 1248 before, they help companies
  add connectivity to their products without them having to spend
  time managing the infrastructure on their own. Deployment of
  devices at scale is a key factor for success of IoT devices. When
  more devices are deployed, there is increased risk of future
  engineering costs and maintenance. Their solution for this is
  their <a href=

  newly announced DevicePilot platform</a>, which works with mbed
  OS to offer companies the ability to deploy and manage policies
  between their devices. Therefore, making it simpler to deploy and
  manage devices at scale.

</p>
<p>
  The IoT connectivity landscape is currently fragmented, however
  by utilizing the mbed IoT Device Platform, the mbed OS helps to
  help bridge these gaps and standardize IoT implementations. Along
  with this, Freescale offers the Kinetis MCU series that offers:
  an optimized low power design, security features, wireless
  connectivity, ease of use and additional choice for IoT
  developers. One example is the mbed Enabled™ <a href=

</p>
<p>
  IBM has set out to tackle the challenge of enabling the creation
  of transformative IoT solutions that are centered around data. An
  example of this can be seen in the video below, where IBM
  demonstrates how a sophisticated and connected construction-hat
  can monitor the vitals, location, etc. of works to allow
  constructions companies to more effectively evaluate their
  workers’ environments and well-being. IBM is enabling their
  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/">IBM
  BlueMix</a> platform to integrate with the mbed Device Server to
  make it easy for developers to seamless create interactions and

<h2>
  <b>Supporting the latest standards in connectivity for IoT – An
  insight into Thread</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Bill Curtis, the Senior Director of Strategy for IoT at ARM and
  board member at The Thread Group, gave insight into Thread’s
  networking protocol. He started off the session by pointing out
  that “the most profound technologies are those that disappear and
  weave themselves into the fabric of life,” as said originally by
  Mark Wiesner. As this trend has started to become a reality with
  IoT, there are two things that devices need to make that happen:
  they must be extremely low-power and small enough to discretely
  integrate into your surroundings; and they must have connectivity
  to tie into the network. Based on those key founding requirements
  Thread is focused on IP-based network connectivity for low power
  devices in the home. Additionally, Thread intends to address
  other requirements of connected home networks such as: whole-home
  coverage, resilient, security, consumer friendly, fast
  time-to-market, worldwide, and most importantly it must use
  existing radios.
</p>
<p>
  One of the key enabling elements of Thread is that the
  “application-layer is agnostic”. This means that it can support
  multiple applications layers (any low bandwidth application layer
  that can run over IPv6) making it easy to integrate with
  applications and IoT devices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Thread is nearing completion with consumer products expected to
  be in the market next year and mbed is helping to provide the
  software needed to build those products.&nbsp;mbed OS includes
  Thread integration with the following benefits, as seen in the
  slide below. Additionally, more information on the technical
  details of Thread can be found in their whitepapers, <a href=
  "http://threadgroup.org/Downloads.aspx">here</a>.

<h2>
  <b>Keys for success: Today’s landscape of IoT technologies and
  security standards</b>
</h2>
<p>
  Pratul Sharma, Technical Marketing Manager, IoT at ARM, presented
  on the standards being used for IoT today and the a few of the
  obstacles we face in the growth of IoT market such as:
  interoperability, scalability, reusability and differentiation.
  Currently, most solutions solve specific vertical application
  requirements in isolation from all others. Overcoming this
  challenge requires adoption of standards for data communication,
  security, device management and uniform end to end security. It
  is important to have a secure and standards based platform that
  can be used for multiple vertical applications. In his talk he
  covered some of the key standards like CoAP, 6LoWPAN, IPSO Smart
  Objects, OMA LWM2M and how we are combining these standards with
  uniform end-to-end security under the mbed IoT Device Platform.
</p>
<p>
  Amit Shah, vice president of Engineering at Alcatel-Lucent, also
  shared how Alcatel-Lucent is helping to define standards within
  IoT. The Alcatel-Lucent MotiveSMART Device Certification Program
  intends to certify devices that have the necessary tools to be
  protocol compliant and have a high level of trust. This program
  helps to catch any bugs early as possible, as the higher in the
  development chain a product goes, the more expensive it is to fix
  bugs later on. Thus lowering the barrier to entry and allowing
  developers and chipset vendors to gain trust through the
  certification program. This program is open to all mbed
  developers and partners, find out more <a href=

<h2>
  <b>Building mbed together: an overview of mbed OS and how to get
  involved</b>
</h2>
<p>
  mbed is an intricate combination of different elements that need
  to interact seamlessly. In order for mbed to succeed we need to
  work together with developers and partners to create an
  environment with boards, modules, operating system, cloud
  services, libraries, and products. In this presentation Hugo
  Vincent, mbed OS Product Lead, and Paul Bakker, Product Strategy
  for IoT at ARM, gave an overview of the newly released mbed OS
  and how to gain access to the mbed technology, support and how
  you can help make mbed a success.

<p>
  Highlights of the mbed OS:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href=
    "https://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-yotta/">yotta</a>
    – mbed OS has a deeply integrated development environment, key
    to which is a tool called yotta. yotta is designed to make it
    easy to re-use software modules, compose them together to form
    libraries, programs, and whole systems. Being a modular OS,
    mbed OS is primarily delivered as yotta modules (about 70-80
    modules) that you can pull in the ones you need to build a
    working application.<br>
