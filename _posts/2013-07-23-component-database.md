<p>
  The new mbed Component Database hosts reusable libraries for
  different hardware, middleware and IoT services that you can use
  with ARM Microcontrollers. These components can be used as
  building blocks for quickly developing prototypes and products.

<p>
  Components and the associated libraries, examples and
  documentation are created and added to the database by mbed
  developers, component manufacturers and service providers. The
  goal is to create a database of rock-solid code and resources for
  many components that can be used with ARM microcontrollers.
</p>
<p>
  The component database can be found at <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/components/">http://mbed.org/components/</a>.
</p>
<h2>
  Helping developers
</h2>
<p>
  The main benefit of the the Component Database for end users is
  to provide a reference point for the best available driver
  library for any supported hardware component.
</p>
<p>
  If a component is in the component database, it should mean that:
</p>
<p>
  1) The component has a library or hello world program available,
  which also has been tested to work to the degree indicated
</p>
<p>
  2) Any updates or improvements to the software library will also
  be found in the same place
</p>
<p>
  3) Discussion and questions relating to the component can happen
  on the component's entry in the database
</p>
<p>
  4) All relevant documentation on the component is collated and
  linked to from the database entry
</p>
<p>
  If you have created a library for a component, all mbed users are
  welcome to create an entry for the component, or add the library
  to an existing entry.
</p>
<h2>
  Helping component manufacturers and library developers
</h2>
<p>
  The component database is the place for mbed developers to find
  purchasing information, support links and product datasheets
  relating to a component.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a component manufacturer, having a component supported
  in the database is a great way to ensure customers can
  confidently buy the component knowing that the minimum of time
  will be needed to integrate it into their design.
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining an mbed library for component(s) can boost the
  visibility of a manufacturer within the mbed community.
  Developers then know that they can potentially talk to actual
  engineers at the manufacturer if needed, which increases the
  confidence the developer will have in integrating products.
  &lt;anufacturers may also link to paid support options and
  contacts to help establish commercial relationships.
</p>
<h2>
  What it is, and what it isn't
</h2>
<p>
  The Component Database is a public database of components,
  libraries, and associated documentation. The entries in the
  database are maintained by component manufacturers and the mbed
  community.
</p>
<p>
  It is the place to put schematics, pinout diagrams, datasheets,
  guides, and any other information which is useful to users of the
  component.
</p>
<p>
  It is not an exhaustive list of all possible variations of a
  component. Nor is it intended to index 'passive' components such
  as switches, resistors, antennas, etc. As a guide, a component
  should only be in the component database if it requires a
  software library to operate. For example, octopart.com lists over
  8 million discrete components. By contrast, the mbed component
  database is expected to cover more in the region of the low
  hundreds of components. It includes online services as well as
  hardware components.
</p>
<p>
  It is not a marketplace for software. Every component can only
  have one library associated with it. It is up to the community to
  maintain that single library to be the best possible library
  serving the needs of the majority of people. This is intended to
  control fragmentation of libraries into several forks, each of
  which serve the needs of only a subset of users. We will shortly
  be adding features to help make this process easier, and welcome
  feedback in this area.
</p>
<h3>
  Adding a component
</h3>
<p>
  Anyone can add a component to the database, and edit existing
  components. Components are not 'owned' by individuals, instead
  the community is responsible for maintaining the database. A
  component however is linked to libraries which are owned by an
  individual, which is then in effect the official maintainer of
  the library for that component.
</p>
<p>
  To add a component, simply navigate to the category you think the
  component should be in, and click the 'Add Component' button.
</p>
<h2>
  The future
</h2>
<p>
  The cookbook wiki will remain freely editable by any mbed
  developer. However we expect and encourage component support
  pages to migrate to the component database, providing that the
  library and documentation are tested, working, and suitable for
  inclusion in the database. If you migrate a component to the
  database, you may edit the cookbook page, pointing visitors to
  it's new home.
</p>
<p>
  We hope the component database will grow to be useful and an
  important part of the mbed developer website. As always, if you
  have any questions, comments or suggestions, they are very
  welcome.
</p>
