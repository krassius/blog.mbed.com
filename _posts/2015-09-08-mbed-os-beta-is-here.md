<p>
  Last October we <a href=
  "http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/arm-announces-device-platform-and-free-os-to-accelerate-internet-of-things-deployment.php">
  announced</a> that ARM and our partners were creating a software
  ecosystem and new operating system for internet-connected
  devices. It offers standards support and focuses on low power and
  security. We believe the Internet of Things (IoT) is all about
  innovators finding new ways to solve problems in our cities,
  enterprises and homes. Over the past year we have closely
  collaborated with leading OEMs, silicon manufacturers,
  infrastructure and cloud players to really understand what
  developers need to take new innovations from idea to deployment.
</p>
<p>
  All of us involved are excited to announce that <b>ARM® mbed™ OS
  is now available for beta testing</b>. We will be releasing mbed
  Device Connector Beta, mbed Client Beta, mbed Device Server 2.5,
  and mbed TLS 2.1.0 over the next few weeks. They can all be found
  on the brand new <a href="http://www.mbed.com/">mbed.com</a>.

<p>
  <i>Let’s give you a quick tour:</i>

<p>
  <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-os/">mbed
  OS</a> is an open source embedded operating system designed
  specifically for the “things” in the Internet of Things. It
  accelerates the process of moving from initial idea to deployed
  product by providing a core operating system, robust security
  foundations, standards based communication capabilities, and
  drivers for sensors, I/O devices and connectivity. The current
  release of mbed OS is of beta quality, as mbed OS is under
  development.

<p>
  <b>Beta testers welcome!</b>
</p>
<h2>
  mbed Device Connector (Beta)
</h2>
<p>
  The <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/development/cloud/mbed-device-connector-service/">
  mbed Device Connector</a> is a new online service for developers.
  It allows developers to connect IoT devices to the cloud without
  having to build their own infrastructure. It provides the
  security, simplicity and capacity developers require to quickly
  prototype and test their applications and ideas in the field.
</p>
<h2>
  mbed Device Server (2.5 release)
</h2><img src=
"http://40.media.tumblr.com/044df601895f0bd60c54fc5ded55af17/tumblr_inline_nud8r3a16M1tcqsn4_540.png"
alt="image" style="float: right;">
<p>
  The <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/development/cloud/mbed-device-server/">mbed
  Device Server</a> is a middleware that connects IoT devices to
  web applications, allowing our Cloud Partners to deploy mbed
  Enabled services. It provides efficient and secure communication
  and device management for quick development and deployment of
  enterprise applications based on open standards.
</p>
<h2>
  mbed TLS (2.1.0 release)
</h2><img src=
"http://41.media.tumblr.com/8259fafbf9a9cdc2f9369fc617d6926a/tumblr_inline_nud8rhh24c1tcqsn4_540.png"
alt="image" style="float: left;">
<p>
  <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/technologies/security/mbed-tls/">mbed
  TLS</a> makes it trivially easy for developers to include
  cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their (embedded)
  products, facilitating this functionality with a minimal code
  footprint. mbed TLS is now delivered under the Apache 2.0
  license.
</p>
<h2>
  mbed Client (Beta)<br>
</h2>
<p>
  The <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-client/">mbed
  Client</a> allows devices not based on mbed OS to connect to mbed
  Device Connector and mbed Device Server. Developers can use it to
  build web applications relying on cloud services provided by ARM
  partners. It implements a subset of mbed OS functionality and is
  optimized for constrained networks and devices. It uses the
  Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to provide
  energy-efficient communication, supports communication security
  using mbed TLS and offers device management with OMA LWM2M. All
  this functionality is provided by clear, high level C++ APIs.
</p>
<p>
  We have a lot in store for the future and are driving our
  roadmaps based on what you as developers need to create
  incredible IoT solutions. Let us know what you think so far!
