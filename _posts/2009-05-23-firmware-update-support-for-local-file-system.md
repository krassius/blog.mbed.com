<p>
  We've just released an mbed Microcontroller firmware update
  (v14366).
</p>
<p>
  This release supports the new LocalFileSystem, and makes a few
  other&nbsp;minor improvements.
</p>
<p>
  To update your Firmware, open the MBED.HTM file on your mbed,
  click&nbsp;"check for firmware updates", and follow the
  instructions. Please tell&nbsp;us if you have any trouble
  updating.
</p>
