  We're on a mission to bring rapid prototyping to
  microcontrollers, and we want you to join us! Introducing the
  mbed challenge...

  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Our
  mission is to bring rapid prototyping to microcontrollers.</span>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3D
  rapid prototyping has come a long way over the last few years and
  we don't think the electronics has kept up. As the way to arrange
  the "atoms" improves</span> <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">(the
  physical form, mechanics,&nbsp;aesthetics), w</span><span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">e
  want to make sure it just as quick to prototype the "bits"
  (the&nbsp;intelligence, behaviour, connectivity).</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">So
  far, we've made a pretty good start with mbed; the tools,
  hardware and peripheral interfaces are all working really well in
  their goal of getting out of the way and letting you concentrate
  on your application. It is also</span> <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">great
  to see how supportive everyone joining the community has been,
  and even better when you see people getting results. Lets try and
  keep it that way!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">But
  we think we've on scratched the surface so far.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Next
  up in our sights is making all the things you might want to
  connect your mbed up to "just work".</span> <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As
  you will have noticed, we've been building in new features in to
  mbed to help with sharing know-how and experience; a cookbook,
  user notebooks, project publishing and, currently in beta
  testing, user libraries. This is the start of what we hope can
  make it possible to pick up any&nbsp;peripheral&nbsp;and have it
  working in a few minutes, or have an idea and be able to find a
  number of building blocks so you aren't starting from
  scratch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">So
  we've teamed up with <a href="http://circuitcellar.com/">Circuit
  Cellar</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elektor.com/">Elektor</a>
  and</span> <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><a href="http://www.nxp.com"
  style=
  "text-decoration: none; color: #0073bd !important;">NXP</a></span>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">to
  bring you the "NXP mbed Design Challenge". This is your chance to
  win some money for helping out!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=

  <br>
  The challenge is to publish a project and the building blocks
  that make it up that is inspiring, inventive, useful or just
  plain cool. The great thing when you publish something like this
  is you are helping your fellow developers prototype even faster
  by building on your work, but you can also enter it in the design
  challenge and win some of the prize money that is up for grabs
  :)<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">We're
  going to use the tag <strong>mbedchallenge</strong> to mark
  things related to this challenge, so if you post anything on mbed
  (notebook, cookbook, forum) or on flickr, youtube etc, make sure
  you tag it with mbedchallenge!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style=
  "font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">For
  all the details of how to enter and the prizes up for grabs, see
