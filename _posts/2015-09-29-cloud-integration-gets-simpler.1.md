  Today companies face an important point of transformation.
  Business decision makers are trying to find the right way in
  which their companies can take advantage of the right Internet of
  Things (IoT) deployments, that these deployments will be able to
  integrate easily with established services and that choice of
  devices, operating system and infrastructure all are
  trusted.<b><br></b>
</p>
<p>
  At ARM mbed, our mission is to empower developers with a platform
  that natively integrates with majority of devices and offers
  access to hundreds of libraries and a growing base of development
  resources – in turn for them to support their companies and
  customers. Recent insights from &nbsp;<a href=
  "http://www.evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=38">Internet
  of Things Study 2015, Volume I</a> by <a href=
  "http://www.evansdata.com/">Evans Data Corporation</a> (EDC)
  suggested that <b>55% of IoT developers primarily connect devices
  through the Cloud</b>. This is a critical step in making
  meaningful data available on the devices and to the cloud
  connected services.

  Today, Microsoft announced their <a href=
  "http://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2015/09/29/azure-iot-suite-now-available/">
  Microsoft Azure Certified</a> for IoT program, centralizing their
  support around the mbed Platform. This announcement would mean
  encouraging news for mbed developers for a few reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ARM mbed IoT Device Platform support for Azure IoT is
  officially available<br>
  </li>
  <li>Devices running mbed OS can run Azure IoT libraries to
  integrate with the new products announced (Azure IoT Suite and
  Hub) using the mbed tools<br>
  </li>
  <li>mbed developers can get started with the first Azure
  Certified for IoT mbed Enabled board: the <a href=
  "http://www.mbed.com/en/development/hardware/boards/freescale/frdm_k64f/">
    Freescale FRDM-K64 board</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Microsoft Azure is used by over 50% of Fortune 500 companies
  making it one of the most powerful business tools for mbed IoT
  developers. The support from Microsoft Azure builds on other chip
  to cloud partnerships with <a href=
  "http://www.rethinkresearch.biz/articles/arm-wins-ibm-analytics-integration-for-its-mbed-iot-device-platform/">
  IBM BlueMix</a> and <a href=
  "http://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2015/09/150915-2.jsp">
  Salesforce.com</a>, growing mbed’s ecosystem. This alignment
  simplifies the complexity for mbed developers to securely
  connect, manage and capture data from sensors and devices, and
  easily integrate and orchestrate the flow of that data to manage,
  analyze and present it as usable information to the people who
  need it to make better decisions.
