<p>
  We are very pleased to announce that we're working with ST on
  enabling STM32 microcontrollers in mbed!

  This has been a very exciting year for us (more on that later -
  lots has been happening), so it is great to have ST joining us to
  help make mbed the best software platform for developing all
  sorts of new microcontroller devices. As you can probably guess,
  we'll be doing a lot next year especially to enable creation of
  IoT devices.

<p>
  The support for the first <a href=
  "http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169" rel=
  "nofollow">STM32 Cortex-M based microcontrollers</a> is being
  developed now, and in February you should see this support go
  live in the software and libraries alongside the first of a new
  line of mbed-enabled boards released from ST. Please tell us if
  you want to be one of the alpha and beta testers (along with your
  credentials as an alpha and beta tester!)
</p>
<p>
  This is going to be an exciting 2014!
