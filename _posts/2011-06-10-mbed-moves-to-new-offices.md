  This week, we've been moving house! Come have a look!
</p>
<p>
  Here is what will become our new workshop:

</p>
<p>
  Currently it feels a little like a school lab with all the water
  taps and benches, but we'll be pulling some of this out to give
  us more room for workspace.
</p>
<p>
  And we have a store now too:

</p>
<p>
  This is for all the components we've accumulated that we
  experiment with. You might be able to see a few billy bass boxes
  in there after our raid on ebay :)
</p>
<p>
  And finally, a view of part of our new office space:

</p>
<p>
  This has lots more room to cope with some of our new recruits,
  and hopefully will stay a little more tidy vs. our previous
  office-and-lab-in-one setup. Will have to see if we can stick to
  that!
</p>
<p>
  This is now our 4th mbed office, and certainly feels quite a
  journey from our 1st; basically a cupboard that we somehow
  managed to squeeze three people in to!
