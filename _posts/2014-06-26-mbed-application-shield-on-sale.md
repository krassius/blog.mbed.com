    This is a peripherals shield - principally designed for mbed
    development boards with an Arduino form factor, it can actually
    be used with *any* development board with an Arduino form
    factor! The shield includes an Xbee socket, a small speaker, a
    3 axis accelerometer, a joystick, and LCD display and other
    stuff! Because the shield has a good range of input / output
    devices on it, it's great for an educational environment Code
    to use the shield with mbed devices is available at mbed.org.

  The shield is supported by various example programs that can be
  used straight out the box, all published on its <a href=
  "http://mbed.org/components/mbed-application-shield/">Component
  Database page</a>, as with the application board interesting new
  applications will soon start appearing!
