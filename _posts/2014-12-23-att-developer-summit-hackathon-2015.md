  AT&amp;T Hackathon – Code for Car and Home</a> in September, we
  have gathered <a href="http://freescale.com/" rel=

  u-blox</a> and ARM back together again to form <a href=
  "https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ATT-Hackathon/">‘Team
  mbed</a>.’ We will be offering a ‘smorgasbord’ of sensors and
  actuators to go along with a variety of <a href=
  "https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/">hardware platforms</a> to
  choose from based on your I/O and connectivity needs (Bluetooth®,
  cellular, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi®). This event is a great place for
  developers to explore new hardware, experiment with innovative
  ideas and get guidance from the experts…not to mention the great
  food and grand prizes! This year the first place winner will be
  taking home $25,000 USD, second place with $10,000 USD and third
  place with $5,000 USD!
