<p>
  Here is a video showing some of the new online collaboration
  features in action:
</p>
<div class="flex-video">
  <iframe width="420" height="315" src=
  "https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0cgrNKhimY" frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
</div>
<p>
  In this case it shows how developers can work together on the
  same codebase. Hopefully you'll see how much work we've put in to
  making it very simple and intuitive!
</p>
<h2>
  Currently in Beta

  These features are currently in private beta. If you want to try

  Thanks for all the people who have been testing it so far!
